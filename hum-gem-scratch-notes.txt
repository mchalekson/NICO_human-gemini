extracted_utterance_data.csv

Used to analyze behavior, idea flow, and group dynamics across meetings




This massive code script (under the Parsing Transcripts from CSV section):

- spent majority of Friday working on this code script. Based on what I want it to do..
it is fine. It is mostly the edge cases. I don't need it to be perfect

Since you're ready to explore the ideas you mentioned, I recommend:
(just a general direction, can always adjust):

- Create a first_speaker flag for each session
- Use start_sec_adjusted to identify early utterances
- Filter for those that include explain or define term or contain keywords like “I'm” or “My research”
- Count participants per session with df['speaker'].nunique()
- Compute meeting_length = df.groupby('session')['end_sec_adjusted'].max()
