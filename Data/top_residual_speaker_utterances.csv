2021_04_22_MND_S5_MND,Kallol Mondal,14.45,meant of the Silog program at large. So um uh they are actually recording the sessions. This is something I'll just say while we're waiting for everyone to be back in the room. One of the things we do is is a study of how new collaborations form and what happens at the meetings that help to lead that so that we can adjust the nature of the meeting. So we actually look at who's assigned in whose rooms and how you interact with one another and then track that over time to see who chooses to write proposals whether those proposals are funded and who ultimately publishes papers together. Um and so we have data now 10 years running on the way that Silog functions to generate new collaborations among people.,False,True,False
2021_04_22_MND_S5_MND,Michael Burton,11.083333333333334,"I can go next. Um, so um my name is uh Michael Burton. I am a uh early fourth year assistant professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. And um my lab is um I guess I'm I'm trained in uh I guess immunophysiology and behavior. So how the immune system um affects the the brain and and various behaviors and my lab is uh neuroimmunology and behavior where we are interested in how the peripheral uh nervous system and peripheral immune system um interact with one another to um change whole body behaviors, metabolism, metabolic function, um whole body and also cell metabolism. Um, and our context are um aging um um different pain states uh and and diet. So not quite microbiome either, but I can I have some small inlets of interest in in there. So um super excited about similar things um why how I can contribute to, you know, the greater microbiome cause, etc. So.",False,True,True
2021_04_22_MND_S8_MND,Thomas Mansell,10.5,"I think that's a great point and one thing I think we need to consider is how orthogonal does a biomarker need to be, right? Certain things, right, you know, blood pressure could be an indicator for stroke too, right? And you know, and so how many, how many data points do you need to resolve a disease state, um, and you know, in terms of bacteria, in terms of, you know, if you're designing sensors, right? How many uh inputs do you need? And that makes, you know, you know, in my world in synthetic biology that makes your cellular circuit much more complex when you have more than one input, right? So, um, you know, the things I would be interested in are the most orthogonal, uh, you know, now, that's a big ask, right? Um, but uh, and also detectable in the physiological range, right? So that's all I need. Um, but uh, I think it's something to consider when you're kind of thinking about the importance of these. Like for example, like butyrate, I mean, has lots of different impacts on all kinds of things. There's inflammation, there's as Bob mentioned the carbon source for uh colonocytes, right? So I feel like when you're thinking for me personally, when I'm thinking about biomarkers, I'm thinking about things that are a lot more specific to particular disease states. Um, but that's just my own interest, that's where I'm coming from.",False,True,True
2021_04_23_MND_S3_MND,Pamela Chang,11.766666666666667,"I'll go next. Um, hi, I'm Pam Chang. I'm an assistant professor at Cornell in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Um, I was actually trained as a chemical biologist and then later on as an immunologist and our lab studies the interactions of the gut microbiota with uh the host, um, through their communication with small molecule metabolites and we use mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease and other um, and also infection with enteric pathogens. And we also develop chemical tools to look at the metabolism of the of the gut microbiome, um, specifically looking at bacterial enzymes that produce these metabolites.",False,True,True
2021_05_20_ABI_S8_ABI,Joyati Deb Roy,12.883333333333333,"Thank you. Um, yeah, so I am, um, associate professor at LSU. I've been here for like, I think this is my seventh year. Um, so the yeah, I work on like, uh, like, uh, unfortunately not in a like, uh, at a much higher resolution like a, uh, I mean, clinical resolution. So I work on, um, mammography. So I one of the things that, um, I'm working on is, uh, building a phase contrast X-ray system for, uh, you know, finding the microcalcification clusters, um, quite early even before the tumor is developed. And so, um, so, uh, we hope that, um, the three, like I, uh, have that innovation, phase image and the, um, the, uh, what's it the, the scatter image, small angle scatter, it's a coherent scattering, scattering process.",False,True,True

Because that's is a really from this internal stress for to stimulate the downstream signal pathway. Um that's what I said what what I thought any diseases or any um uh signal the stress in the gut uh the GI system or the gut uh system could actually imbalance and disrupt that this is a wild balance in the microbiome and the species.",False,True,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S3_ABI,Alexandra Walsh,13.25,"Yeah. I think I'm last. Um I'm Alex. I'm an assistant professor at Texas A&M. I've been here almost two years now. And I do similar stuff, so that was great. Um we do uh collagen SHG imaging also, but we primarily focus on label free imaging with fluorescence.",False,True,True
2021_05_21_ABI_S3_ABI,Alexandra Walsh,13.85,"And so we do both single and multi photon fluorescence looking at collagen. And other things like NADH and FAD. So NADH and FAD are coenzymes used in metabolism processes. They just happen to fluoresce. It's like the background fluorescence for any other assay, right? Um but we use quantitative fluorescence imaging to look at both the intensity and the lifetime of NADH and FAD for label free imaging of cell metabolism. And then our applications are looking at things like drug response um of cancer. So drugs can alter the cell metabolism and we can use that to tell if the can if the drugs will work for different cancer patients and like uh preorganoids and ex size samples.",False,True,False

I'm the director of science for the Kavli Foundation and as you can see background do astrophysics, nanoscience, neuroscience. So, you know, very interested in this whole area and doing biosignatures and whatnot meetings for quite a number of years now. Looking forward to hearing what you all say. So, but I'm mostly just listening.",False,True,True
2021_06_11_SLU_S5_SLU,Liz McCormack,15.15,"Hi everyone. Um, my background happens to be, I'm a physicist and I I spent my career using laser techniques to understand small molecules in the gas phase with with applications to some um astronomical environments in atmospheres. But principally, I'm here as a former uh director at RCSA, um, and very um interested in in in the Scilog programs and and how they're developing. So I'm going to be listening in and um, I'll just put in a plug for I was really intrigued by the the notion of looking at energy and entropy and, you know, kind of global signatures of of um of the way life uh changes the uh entropic character of environments. I don't know if you guys are going to go that way, but that was pretty cool to hear about. Anyways, I'm looking forward to listening in. Thanks, Tori.",False,True,True
2021_09_30_MZT_S4_MZT,Sandra Laney,16.833333333333332,"I think if the formatting is such that you can't can't um just kind of back space to get rid of that white space, sometimes if you go and you shift and enter at the same time, it will get rid of that white space so that you don't have that big gap.",False,True,False
2021_10_01_MZT_S4_MZT,Bethany McGregor,10.833333333333334,"Yep, I will be doing this. So uh Brenda took the notes and I'll be doing the report out and this is kind of a great segue from the previous conversation on spillover.",False,True,False
2021_10_01_MZT_S4_MZT,Bethany McGregor,11.016666666666667,"Uh the precision surveillance room had a great conversation, um very lively. Um and we identified several gaps, ideas and challenges uh to report out about. So, um from a gaps perspective, um infrastructure gaps are huge. So technologically speaking, you know, having sensors and tools to do monitoring and precision surveillance, you know, there are some tools out there already, there are some sensors coming online, but really we need to be, you know, filling some of these infrastructure gaps to develop these these necessary tools. Having the people with the necessary expertise to do the surveillance can be a challenge, especially on the scale that we realistically need to do, you know, so much surveillance for so many diverse uh pathogen systems out there. Um and then, you know, a similar concept that was discussed yesterday after the vector born disease is surveillance follows the money. Um and, you know, there's not always a lot of money in in the prevention, there's the money in the cleanup after something happens. Um and so realistically finding ways to fund um the surveillance aspects so we can prevent a problem before it even becomes an issue, um is going to be key. Um, we need to be developing novel and and newer technologies and deploying those in the field. I know there are several new technologies that are being tested right now all all around the world. Um, but really getting those up and online um sooner rather than later is is key to preventing the next, you know, big outbreak. Um, we need to be optimizing where surveillance is being conductive. Um, and and this is kind of in reference to, you know, in areas where you've got a university or you've got a big city, you tend to have a whole lot of surveillance going around in a very limited scope around those locations. But then you've got the rest of the world that maybe isn't getting nearly enough surveillance, you know, effort going into them. So are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck. Um, we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech. Um and we also talked about the possibility of using environmental DNA techniques for the surveillance of of smaller animals and vectors, um where you maybe can't put wearable tech on a mouse or a mosquito, um but you can use DNA that's present in the environment to kind of monitor and surveil those populations. Um and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologist. So you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for. So finding a way to bridge that gap so we can make sure there's clear communication in the precision surveillance tools that we're looking for. So we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um, and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um, so you know, possibly using color sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposited deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um, and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um, and then challenges and opportunities. This left us with a lot of questions and not always a lot of answers. Um and that's because surveillance has to kind of assume a lot of different forms based on what you're looking at. So surveiling for mosquito board diseases is going to be very different from surveiling for brucelosis. And so we kind of talked about some of those differences and challenges moving forward. Um, and ultimately how does precision testing translate into action? So we can test for everything in the world, we can do all the surveillance in the world, but how do we take those data and actually put them into action and and act on them. Um, how what do you do and when do you enact some type of action after after making that surveillance. Um, realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals. So so there's a very real challenge in uh kind of bridging those cultural barriers and even legal barriers with our our farm so we can do surveillance, but not in a way that harms anybody's livelihood. Um, so like I said, very good conversation in our group. We talked about a lot of things. I tend to think we're the best group.",True,True,False
