2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:112:1,Carolyn Bayer,1218.081999999998,Inform/Report,"alternatively, I mean just to describe what how we get around the limitation in photoacoustic imaging is that",2,3,49.02199999999948,0.75412923,True
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:121:1,Carolyn Bayer,1218.0909999999978,Inform/Report,So we we so there's there's essentially two different strategies for photoacoustic imaging.,2,3,49.01299999999969,0.74982464,True
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:122:1,Carolyn Bayer,1218.0919999999978,Inform/Report,"So, um, my spatial resolution is not going to be even close to what all the optical microscopists um can do.",1,2,49.01899999999955,0.7087186,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:121:2,Carolyn Bayer,1218.0909999999978,Inform/Report,There's optical resolution photoacoustic imaging and that those are the super impressive like vascular networks that you see in the papers.,1,2,48.960000000000946,0.69505346,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:51:1,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,1218.0209999999995,Inform/Report,That kind of moves us a bit away from uh considering deep tissue applications specifically.,1,1,49.02699999999936,0.77457637,True
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:122:2,Carolyn Bayer,1218.0919999999978,Inform/Report,So I'm spatial resolution is more in the 100 to 200 micron.,1,1,49.01899999999955,0.75823283,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:0:6,Brad Smith,615.0,Inform/Report,So the lack of deep tissue imaging is the problem I'm trying to avoid or trying to get around.,1,1,67.0,0.75715864,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:23:4,Steve Jett,1122.0,Inform/Report,So for me deep tissue imaging means I'm looking at a piece of tissue excised from somewhere deep in an organism.,1,1,96.07999999999811,0.74609524,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:111:1,Carolyn Bayer,1218.080999999998,Inform/Report,"Um, you know, I do photoacoustics which is using um optics to excite to then ultrasound acoustics to receive.",1,1,48.94000000000142,0.730591,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:2:2,Brad Smith,661.0,Inform/Report,Either your problem that you're trying to solve in deep tissue or the modality that you think you can bring to the problem.,1,1,77.0,0.7292202,False

2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:5:5,Aniruddha Ray,682.0,Inform/Report,And that's what is my interest in deep tissue imaging.,1,1,56.0,0.69875497,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:92:3,Sixian You,1218.0619999999983,Inform/Report,"Uh, so recently there are starting to have efforts uh to shift to longer wavelength so that not only the excitation is in the infrared region, but also the emission is also in.",1,1,49.03999999999928,0.6965548,False
2021_05_21_ABI_S15_ABI:99:3,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,1218.0689999999984,Inform/Report,And so kind of would much rather quantify an increase in fluorescence.,1,1,48.938000000001466,0.68083227,True
