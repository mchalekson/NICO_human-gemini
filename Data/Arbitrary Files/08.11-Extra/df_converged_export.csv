So I wonder if it's possible that um that you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific times of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease.

So we need to also think about environments that will be similar to early earth to go pick up those redfield ratios to make prediction and not necessarily in the open ocean today for example or uh other type of uh environment that are not representative of this early earth.

Um and so you make a template spectrum that has you know that that has like the various isotopologues that you think might be present and you cross correlate against the noise and by leveraging the the the power of the entire broad spectrum, you get out a signal, you get out you know there's there's there's a match and there's a better match with one with one template than another.

Lisa Kaltenegger,"I think just like a very short comment on that, like talking to the biologists that do evolution, they don't really care about the moon. They uh, I think this is sometimes a notion that we have because we have one, but they are saying if life actually evolved on a planet without a moon where the the climate is maybe not as stable or seasonal, shouldn't matter, especially not if it's in the ocean or subsurface or if it evolved for it. So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started. That's uh kind of line of thought that a couple of people were thinking about making a moon potentially important.

But so something that we're working on now really to try to uh to find a a new way um it's it's pretty straightforward actually, but any way to try to uh to generalize the Opic method to different um to different configurations and to generalize to general rocks that they can come from wherever and not necessarily from uh you know, the same plane that Jupiter lies.

Ziming Yang,"Yeah, I agree. I think uh, you know, even on earth, you know, we have uh, you know, a variety of organisms, microorganisms that can live under those extreme environments, right? Like from very acidic to very basic pH and and also you know like the boiling point of water. So they can survive under those extreme conditions. Uh but the question I think, you know, will be uh so we only know those exist like on earth, but maybe like in outer, you know, exoplanets. So if there's life, they can also get adapted, right? So adapting to the to those specific environments, right? So they can evolve to maybe uh even like robust organisms, they can survive even more extreme environments. So that's something we don't know yet. You know, we only have earth as example, but we don't know if this is the case, you know, those are the limits for these organisms to live, right?
