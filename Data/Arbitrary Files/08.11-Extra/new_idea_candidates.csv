2021_04_22_MND_S5,Michael Burton,665.0,"I can go next. Um, so um my name is uh Michael Burton. I am a uh early fourth year assistant professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. And um my lab is um I guess I'm I'm trained in uh I guess immunophysiology and behavior. So how the immune system um affects the the brain and and various behaviors and my lab is uh neuroimmunology and behavior where we are interested in how the peripheral uh nervous system and peripheral immune system um interact with one another to um change whole body behaviors, metabolism, metabolic function, um whole body and also cell metabolism. Um, and our context are um aging um um different pain states uh and and diet. So not quite microbiome either, but I can I have some small inlets of interest in in there. So um super excited about similar things um why how I can contribute to, you know, the greater microbiome cause, etc. So."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Joel Bornstein,965.0,"Okay, we have a recorder."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Lee Berg,1072.0,"Um and as you guys know um, you know, secondary bile acids that's a, you know, big thing in science these days and how it"
2021_04_22_MND_S5,All,641.0,"Sure. Sure. Cool. Thank you, that'll be great."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Stephanie Grainger McOgga,729.0,So I would say like generally things less than a molecular weight of 500 would be a small molecule to me. Like a primary or secondary metabolite.
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Jeff Dongga,852.0,"Yeah, you know, I I generally don't don't know enough about this area, but what I do understand from, you know, other people's uh work is that the blood brain barrier is not what we were taught in, you know, graduate school or medical school. it's it's far leakier than and far um dynamic than than than is just the impenetrable um separation between um uh, you know, the the the the privileged organ of the brain, which is really uh uh I think a mis uh uh characterization of the brain. In fact, there's a lot of trafficking in in between um even in healthy state."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Stephanie Grainger McOgga,911.0,Sure.
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Liang Song,,"Yeah, I could definitely comment about the um um unannotated peaks uh unannotated uh features that Stephanie was alluding to. Um we use a a vendor called Metabolon um to do untargeted um metabolomics on um on plasma or serum samples from from our patients. And um basically we get about about like almost 8,000 features. Um and each of them um pertain to specific peaks in the mass spectra. Only about 10 only about a thousand of those are annotated. And definitely when we do when we run the statistics, it's like, okay, like there is a lot majority of the peaks that are found to be significant in in the context of a particular, you know, case control study are unannotated. I mean, we know these are, you know, some of them may be junk or like, you know, adducts and stuff, but um these are like really important stuff and no one knows how to annotate them and as Stephanie was mentioning to, like it takes a long time. It's a bottleneck to actually know what the structure is and and know and validate these uh molecules. It's like almost a whole PhD project."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Liang Song,,"Per molecule per molecule, yeah, yeah."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,William Zuercher,,"Yeah, that's a good point. And especially, I mean, you know, dopamine, for example, is pretty important in learning. Um, and I wonder if that relates at all to the novelty, like the novel object responses that you see in the lab, um, that are affected by changes in gut microbiome. Yeah."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Jial Rongge Xue,699.0,"And and and I I will add to that is the gut is not as just um uniform, you know, there's a lot of concern that we're looking at fecal microbiome, um, but that does not represent say for example what what goes on in the small intestine, which is a different environment, um, than say the colon and and and and and and so forth. And you know, in terms of sort of um uh uh Wenjing back to your question about what kind of approaches people sort of take to the system. I I you know, obviously there are many ways. Um, so so some of the some of our approaches doing these different multiomic um uh data collection uh taking from the gut microbiome to generate from from the stool sample to generate the the genome data but looking at at uh not just at the community but at the functional level through based on sequencing. Uh looking at the transcriptomics in in the um uh through in our case we're interested in immune system so looking at the the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, um, looking at the metabolome uh from the in the blood because that's a kind of uh uh a measuring looking at some of the the targeted metabolites um that are the the the functional readout of the gut bacterial function. Um and and and and then then applied um network approaches to reduce the dimensionality of the testing and then look for um uh association that can give us a hypothesis that we can test for example, um, you know, does short chain fatty acid shift the peripheral immune system in certain direction then therefore increase the risk for for certain neuroinflammatory disease as as a as a a testable hypothesis."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Paul Hsu,,"So actually a couple years ago to that exact question. Um, so what we did was we took mice, we transplanted um, different gut microbial populations into them. So we had like, I think four or five different groups. And then we quantitatively imaged the brains of those mice and essentially we did um, and Joel and Jay, I know love this. You just basically it's like a large data set problem and you just basically mash them together. So we did uh, we did a K fold uh validation, uh random forest supervised learning study and we're able to show that, you know, certain areas of the brain where we saw structural change, we could actually say that's because we had this Roseburia here in the gut. And then we had this microstructural change over here and that's due to, you know, bifidobacterium in the gut. And make those statistical associations between gut microbial populations in the brain. The the problem with that as you know is these are pure statistical associations and the actual biology is a little bit opaque, like why do we see that? So it's hard to validate uh those sort of studies."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Zongqi Xia,,"Uh yeah, it's Zongqi."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,John,645.0,"Yeah, there's a lot of study being done that's on this um throughout lifespan. Typically, at least what what we understand is, um microbiome is quite dynamic uh up till age three or four um uh years and then has a fairly stable um uh but but there there could be dramatic perturbation whether it's antibiotics or um you know, travelers diarrhea for example, th- those are kind of uh uh but but but short of these um uh perturbant perturbance uh the adult, well, even even above age three because it's not really adult, the microbiome remain fairly stable over time. over over over a human lifespan."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Michael D Cullinan,971.0,"Yeah, I I know those guy actually Vegas person but we didn't we never touched it so I didn't want to get involved too much too too deep into it. But yeah, there's a lot to unpack there."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Joel Bango Kote,1050.0,"I think that's actually uh, well maybe we can phrase it in a slightly different way. Um, so so you know, um folks talked about the looking at different levels of the gut microbiome, there are there are changes. But I think even, you know, at a higher level sort of um, when you have so much noise uh in in the human gut microbiome. So if you look at individual and individual change uh over time, that using that same person but at different time points as as sort of the um, the the comparators that that can give you some idea if you can correlate that with clinical outcome whether that's the onset of a disease or other intermediate phenotypes such as changes in the metabolome in the blood, etc. So that give you some sort of temporal having that temporal component uh give you some sort of uh, you know, not just association but maybe give you some sort of causal effect if you will. Um,"
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Jill Panzer Godager,632.0,"I think that's probably an underlying theme in a lot of these comments, right? Is the tools part."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Gillian Zuberberg,777.0,"Yeah, you know, in principle, right, it sounds from that like you'd be you could imagine like a workshop where people just like present all the tools that they that are available and and other scientists could go and and sort of find the things that are most relevant. That turns out not to work that well and for whatever reason in my experience at least you you get more benefit from um explaining from the science and like what specific thing is needed and then people suggesting things like, oh, you know, if you use this thing and maybe stick together this other tool with it then, you know, that'll solve the problem. Um, I don't know."
2021_04_22_MND_S5,Unknown speaker,845.0,Thank you.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Alda Ebrahimi,900.0,Okay.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Aida Ebrahimi,677.0,"No, no, no, they are secreted. So like in the extracellular solution. And these are in the so whatever they, so let's say they are metabolizing something, they uptake that thing and from the environment. So we can monitor the level of that."
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Aida Ebrahimi,752.0,"I think in some sense they are also, you know, we are talking about biomarkers. And maybe that's a definition issue amongst the field that I don't understand. Um, so for example, you know, when Bob was today talking about short fatty acids. So that's a biomarker. So let's say we can build a sensor to monitor the level of those. And"
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Yanjiao Zhou,1056.0,Of the gut.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Yanjiao Zhou,1056.0,Yes.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Aida Ebrahimi,893.0,Sorry.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Barbara Bendlin,1043.0,Yeah.
2021_04_22_MND_S4,Barbara Bendlin,761.0,Could you add 4.1? Um the idea being start with germ free mice at microbiota and do metabolomics.
2021_04_23_MND_S1,Robin Michelle Voigt,1149.0,"The best well-studied group that I know of today, at least is Alzheimer's disease. Um, so there's like a large um consortium that's going on right now to answer this very question in Alzheimer's disease. So they're getting samples, stool samples and serum samples from people from around the world who have Alzheimer's disease to answer this very question. You know, there's been hints that, you know, generally short chain fatty acids at least are reduced in a lot of neurodegenerative diseases. Um, you know, and we know that they're good for gut health by influencing they it fortifies the intestinal barrier. So that's one potential mechanism. Um, but as far as, you know, you need a lot of data points to be able to generally say whether you always see this or"
2021_04_23_MND_S1,Faranak Fattahi,992.0,"But that would be skipping a whole bunch of steps, right? Like from the metabolite to behavior. Um you know, what's happening in the middle with all the different cells that are getting exposed to that metabolite and how the signal gets transmitted from one from the gut to the brain and so I think maybe incorporating more cellular models in this like you know, paradigm would be useful."
2021_04_23_MND_S1,Faranak Fattahi,658.0,"I think we have the problem is not generating the relevant cells. So you can generate intestinal epithelial cells, neurons, you know, a lot of different cell types. The question is what what's the most appropriate readout? Like, for instance, with neurons, are you looking for neuronal activity? Are you looking for secretion of a particular cytokine or growth factor? Are you looking for a switch in the metabolic state? And so, you know, the first one, the activity readout is scalable, so you can do that high throughput. But if you're looking for a global switch in the metabolic state, that's not scalable, right? So maybe you can start with some scalable readouts, you have 100 candidates, narrow that down to five, and then for those five, look at how those five affect the metabolic shift in the neurons. And then from there, test them on mouse models. So like a sequential study with different degrees of complexity."
2021_04_22_MND_S8,Noah Palm,786.0,"I would almost argue though the opposite, which is that really what you want to get the strongest signal are the people who have no genetic predisposition. But uh regardless of that, end up actually getting Alzheimer's, which would suggest that they have a stronger actually environmental or microbial component. And the people who are have genetically predisposed would actually have a weaker signal for non-genetic biomarkers."
2021_04_22_MND_S8,George Weinstock,897.0,"Depression, right?"
2021_04_22_MND_S8,Carolina Tropini,744.0,I understood the question is of finding molecules that are modified by the microbiota that ideally would influence the brain whether it's crossing the blood brain barrier and making it through and among those dead lists like there's things like GABA. There's various other neurotransmitters that are modified and some of the things that we talked about during the talk like short chain fatty acids and bile acids are also kind of low hanging fruits.
2021_04_22_MND_S8,Kaixiong Ye,850.0,"I totally agree with that. For the purpose of diagnosis, we don't need a causal biomarker."
2021_04_23_MND_S16,Nandita Garud,551.0,Hi.
2021_04_23_MND_S16,Yang,791.0,"Sorry. My name is Yang, you can hear me now?"
2021_04_23_MND_S16,Zongqi Xia,1121.0,"Absolutely. Absolutely. Just like single, just like RNA seek data, metagenome data, you can develop co-abundance groups based on the correlation structure, data driven. But then, but that's just the first step. There's also functional inference based on the metagenome, which then can be another way of grouping information that's more um"
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Faranak Fattahi,,"You know, more of the latter, but I mean, who knows? We we really don't understand the interneurons. Well, we don't really fully understand what they respond to the sensory component of the nervous system what we called the afferent neurons. They have a lot of different receptors and modalities they respond to. So we don't know if they have the capability to respond to these products directly. But you know, just based on the anatomy, it looks like they would be getting things post processing after, you know, the exposure to the epithelial cells and other cellular components."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Judith Eisen,,"That's a that's a really great question because I think there's pretty clear evidence that microbes in a community behave differently than individual microbes and uh depending on whose gut you're talking about, some of them are culturable and some of them are not culturable."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Kai Zhang,61.0,"control of the of the patterning of the surface receptor. So I was thinking maybe we can first learn spatial patterning of maybe a piece of intestine and also it's rather than using a mouse a mass culture or even just like a microfluidic channel, we can design the pattern."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Sarkis Mazmanian,285.0,I think that that's I personally think that's a really powerful way to go about it and I know people that are doing this right? That are putting together communities of organisms 80 to 100 organisms um where two different communities differ by either one microbe or two the microbes are the same between the two communities except one has a mutant in a particular microbial pathway. So right you get all these other background effects all these micro micro effects micro effects but also the system is very clean in the fact that the the differences between those two communities aren't like the difference between me and you will or my your microbiome.
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Faranak Fattahi,407.0,That's a really important point. For instance if you let's say build up the model with sensory neurons or cortical neurons and then inter neurons would you see differential response to metabolites? And and within the inter neurons you have different kinds of like you have motor neurons sensory components inter neurons are there differences even within the subsets of inter neurons and that can be captured then would that be physiologically relevant. And so that's another thing where I guess the scale could be useful. It might be not very accurate compared to what you get in vivo but you can at least you know scale it up and run the analysis across multiple kinds of cells in parallel.
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Judith Eisen,465.0,[Silence]
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Kai Zhang,526.0,[Laughter]
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Xin Qi,127.0,"And what model will be most suitable to do this sort of research. Uh that's what I thought. Um so my for my understanding the vivo model might be most suitable, right? Because but this is for this session we are talking about if there is cell culture model available, if we can establish some cell culture model, make it our research more simplified. So the thing is this is my valuable question. Um you know, we we we all work on the lab or benchmark, we use the culture models and if like we are so simplified for based on the discussion, we actually um come out the cell culture model. I just really um my question is how how great the society accept the cell culture model and is this is a model that people thought this is a really gut brain communication model or actually this is a simplified we really pick up the single cell like epithelial cells and neuronal cells stimulate stimulate with the microbiome. So this is the question I I I kind of confusing and also I I think that the microbiome species and the model system is probably the key for this whole field."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Sarkis Mazmanian,366.0,"It doesn't tell you that the microbiome is is, you know, a cause or consequence, right? At least it gives you can microbes and molecules, right? That may be a product of that environment, right? The person, what you know, all their physical, emotional, you know, uh, you know, dietary exposures, what have you, right? you know, and reduce it down to at least one dimension, that's the microbiome, right? you can't look at everything. But now you have candidates and then I think that may be a good starting point because you're starting with human data, right? And and asking can you reduce that down to, you know, a level where you believe that that what you're gleaning from human data is giving you a physiological."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Faranak Fattahi,387.0,"Yeah, I like the idea of the modularity."
2021_04_22_MND_S3,Sarkis Mazmanian,452.0,"as I said I I favor that approach, right? Because again it's it's grounded at least the the starting point is human data, right? And it shouldn't be at the expense of let's say De novo discovery, right? Because human data is not going to tell you everything. And so um you know, multiple labs will approach the same problem. Some will take a agnostic approach or high throughput approach. Others are more candidate approach I guess. But again, both are I favor starting with with some some data, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,831.0,"So so your comment is is to define what is maybe if you think specifically on on, you know, small molecules produced by by gut bacteria and or maybe um host induction of small molecules by the microbiome, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,,"How could how could one one do that that wouldn't imply, you know, testing one molecule with mice because that that would just make it too too lengthy. So so is there is there a question if I I think is is are there ways, you know, so if you now take a library of molecules potentially that you believe are important in a particular physiological context, you know, one way to assign function maybe something we were talking about a couple minutes ago is to then use more high throughput um approaches to define the function of these of these molecules before, you know, you start doing any mouse experiments, for example."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Elaine Hsiao,,"Um, or yeah, or maybe the communication in the eferent direction is not through the fibers and is through immune or molecules instead. So yeah, I know these are kind of naive like very high level thoughts but I I I wonder um, about that."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Ashley Ross,,"So I know they've done things where they'll like um give OH, I think it's OHDA that'll cut off the uh sympathetic neural neural innervation in the gut and it really screws up a lot of things."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,,"I I just so after actually mentioned, I just remembered a study from a couple of years ago where they gave six hydroxy dopamine to the the in mice and the mice had constipation. If I remember correctly. I'll I'll dig up the paper right now but so that maybe that there there are some examples, right? Again, how that's mediated I'm not sure."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,1143.0,"So the physiological response almost like a it alerts you to the fact that there may be you know, because again, you don't feel anything in your brain, right? But at least you can feel something, you know, physiologically. So it alerts you that something's going on, that there's an emotion that that triggered that physiological response. So the the response actually alerts you to the fact that there's you should now be more mindful."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Tanya Nguyen,850.0,"Well, we know that meditation techniques it essentially activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Um and that's how it like has much of its beneficial effects on physiological functioning. So maybe something as quote easy as that could at least hijack some of these processes that might be going on or slow down kind of the negative connections, so to speak."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,969.0,"Microbiome or again infectious disease or cancer rates or or something that you can attribute to to, you know, an effect on the immune system, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Sarkis Mazmanian,999.0,Kai is the Kai you're muted. Uh you're the reporter.
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Kai Zhang,1023.0,"54, yeah."
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Melanie Gareau UC Davis,867.0,Okay.
2021_04_23_MND_S11,Kai Zhang,905.0,54.
2021_04_23_MND_S6,JP Yu,603.0,"Um, and specifically towards, you know, identifying these biomarkers. We're really interested in, uh, elucidating the biological transformations that are occurring in the brain that drive the actual quantitative imaging findings that we're finding on our imaging. Um, as a part of this process, uh, you know, we started to realize that we're having a lot of difficulty with, uh, both, uh, reproducibility and, you know, the rigor of a lot of the experiments that are out there. And we actually stumbled upon the fact that, uh, we're learning that the different gut microbial populations are really driving a lot of unexpected and unanticipated changes in the quantitative microstructure in the brain that we're all using. And so now, uh, the lab has taken a hard left turn and now we're really starting to examine how, uh, the gut microbiome is really influencing, uh, neural structural, neural functions. We're using both PET and MR technologies. Um, and really trying to basically reverse engineer imaging and try to figure out how, uh, these sort of genetic and environmental factors are driving the the factors that we're seeing, uh, in translational medical imaging."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Robert Bryan,796.0,No one? It it's an honor to be uh a scribe. I got to assure you.
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Michael D Coleman,685.0,All right.
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Xiao,785.0,"So, uh, we, we have been doing this, uh, I can't even similar to the question you're asking. Uh, basically, uh, we are looking at the alpha synuclein related induced Parkinson disease or alpha synuclein mutation related to Parkinson disease. Uh, our idea is that, you know, the, the, the patient actually carry the alpha synuclein, they show higher level or they have the alpha synuclein mutation. Uh, so this is the thing, so we kind of really prevent. However, uh, the gut microbiome or this is the stress from gut actually may form the inflammatory stress that actually track back to the brain which actually is further stimulate alpha synuclein aggregation or toxicity. That is what we thought."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Irene Yang,1058.0,"Reaches a threshold and and um leads to Alzheimer's disease. Just the idea that, you know, even epidemiologically that people"
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Michael O'Bananu Coleman,866.0,"I'm fairly familiar with it because it's a research project I'm involved with. Yeah, but there's a good amount of projection because I wouldn't have been able to answer the question like a month ago. Um there's a fair amount of projection coming from the NTS that goes up um peribrachial that that up into, you know, areas etc etc what you're saying. And there's also some really interesting um uh reverse projections from the NTS that go to the efferent arm of the Vegas too, which is another conversation for maybe later or or what have you. So."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Robert Bryant Jr,983.0,"But what bothers me is that in these pathological states, there tends to be a leaky gut barrier. And I don't."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Robert Bryant Jr,1060.0,"Wayne, I have to ask you a question. You said uh antibiotics that don't cross the gut barrier. But what bothers me is that in these pathological states, there tends to be a leaky gut barrier. And I don't."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Raffi Maya Levi,1115.0,under um physiological changes of of the barrier. Um and if not maybe the the sensing of of bacteria is only mediated by either secreted molecules or I don't know cyto kind or or metabolites that are secreted from from different cells.
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Jeff Thompson,688.0,"But I do think there's some experimental data at least from the oral or nasal microbiome showing that bacteria that are present at those epithelial surfaces uh can traffic across the the barrier and into the the brain and can actually be viable and live there. So it's not coming from the gut, um but it's another microbiome surface uh that that can directly at least shows as an example that that that bacteria can can do this."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Jeff Thompson,1085.0,But I don't think anybody and again correct me if I'm wrong uh knows really uh how the the peripheral or systemic inflammatory signals are.
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Silvia Rossbach,,"Okay. Who's Brian and Charles? Mation, you need to click the the join button."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Laura Eisen,,"I'll just say, I think that's a a huge open question, how much communication there is between circulating immune cells and compartmentalized immune cells. So, you know, even in the gut, there are compartmentalized immune cells like the muscularis macrophages and um you know, how much how much trafficking there is and what are the conditions that allow that trafficking to happen? Is this something that happens during during some sort of routine surveillance uh to maintain a healthy state or is this something that only happens when there's pathology? I think I think we don't understand that very well."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Leslie Eisen,608.0,"Yeah, great."
2021_04_23_MND_S6,Unknown speaker,855.0,Thank you.
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Ali Keshavarzian,1067.0,I missed two people?
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Ali Keshavarzian,895.0,And there was the area in the ocean that there was no uh the old plume. Uh and those uh uh goblet and they microbiologists they studied of that part and the reason there was no uh the oil plume was that the bacteria in that area adopted to utilize oil as a as a resource. And therefore they got rid of the the bacteria in just a one example.
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Shikha Nangia,1166.0,"Yes, so molecular dynamic simulations, but uh if we need to get uh to the atomistic level, we do that, we do coarse graining and different level of resolutions depending on the questions being asked."
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Marie,694.0,"Um, either or. I actually go by Claire, but I have my full name there, so yeah."
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Marie,773.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Will Ludington,787.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Heather Bean,1073.0,We've got 15 minutes remaining.
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Abhishek Shrivastava,709.0,"So essentially, you know, the point that you made of also bacteria using phages essentially or you know, through chemical skews or just via physical interactions is is important. But then how do we, you know, get a read out for that in from an in vivo setting is something that I don't know. Maybe we can look for phage genomes that are encoded but you know, that's could be one thing or we can just look, you know, do we know what exact number of phages or I think we have a this is a 15 minute warning. So now we have 15 minutes."
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Marie,1020.0,"And also it's important to consider that um in you know, the the the importance of a species in an ecosystem may or may not follow abundance. There's there's important top down effects. It's speculated that that um protests and other eukaryotic microorganisms that that occur at a lower frequency, they can have an important um effect on diversity of the bacterial ecosystem in overall the microbiome ecosystem because of the their predatory effect that has been really well described in other microbial ecosystems as well. So I think this idea that you're alluding to to go outside of bacteria and go more into the multi kingdom well I guess are not really a kingdom but multi clay approach and trying to study the the true ecology of the microbiome. It is methodologically quite complex though, especially for just the one lab. I would argue would require a lot more collaboration."
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Marie,776.0,"To to understand the emergent properties of the microbiomes. These may be more easily detected in simpler systems that once we initially propose will be important. But then how do they truly impact what we would be studying here, the gut brain axis and do they really remain important when the ecosystem becomes more saturated? And then how to measure that along the way."
2021_04_23_MND_S7,Marie,827.0,45. Thank you. I'm so glad somebody's on.
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Jaeyun Sung,605.0,"Um so that's kind of more on the clinical and translational side. On the more basic science side, we do uh uh bioinformatics studies um of uh microbial genomes to identify what chemicals, natural products they could be producing and how those uh chemicals could influence uh uh host disease um in the context of autoimmunity."
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Pamela Chang,714.0,We use mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease and infection. We're interested in the gut brain axis obviously. Um and the other half of my lab works on developing chemical tools to probe the metabolism of the gut microbiota and uh this we're really interested in looking at enzymatic activities carried out by uh bacteria in the gut.
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Mark Mimee,798.0,And my group is essentially uh a synthetic biology microbiome group. So we're really interested.
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Unidentified Speaker,340.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Will Ludington,492.0,"Um that is the kind of the point of some of the questions in there. And I'm just curious like to hear people's thoughts about you know, is it one thing that's being sensed or is it kind of a profile things being sensed and how is, you know, if it is one thing like how is is there a directed channel for that thing or is it kind of a distributed network? Um is there a synapse or is there a distributed network that's kind of pulling that signal in?"
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Mark Mimee,663.0,"Has that been shown in different diseases? Like those that microbial activity in the gut to actually affect uh behavior or whatever, you know, neurological phenotype you're looking at."
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Emily Balskus,,"You would need to also know about the actual metabolic pathways in order to to design Right. a substrate, yeah."
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Elizabeth Bess,352.0,"Yeah, yes. So what the the thought is is we make an assumption in the field that iron is mostly in the reduced state in the gut because the gut is a reducing environment, but um, but there are times when there is more iron three oxidized form, which can happen through inflammation, um, through you know, production of Ross or nitric oxide species. Um, but yeah, bacteria do secrete siderophores in uh the the microbiome. The human also secretes enzymes to capture uh iron three, reduce it to iron two so that it can be brought inside of cells. But I think we have a poor understanding of the dynamics of that. Um, how much of the iron is three versus two. I also fascinated that we have that the body it's the iron is so valuable as you know, as we know, for so many processes that there's no way for the body to um, the body doesn't regulate iron levels except for excretion through stool. That's its only way to get like rid of it. Um, and it's um, but we don't understand really the dynamics of what's happening there and um what the the yeah, oxidation states are and how this changes with dysbiosis of a microbiome. Um, what does this mean at like an uh metal a metal level specifically iron is what what I'm you know wonder about."
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Lisa Osborne,,"getting the rest of this over here. Uh, there was a good conversation about tracking these metabolites and so different approaches to doing that. Um, C13 labeling, like I think it was Elizabeth was saying it's really easy if you know what candidate you're looking at, you can make a C13 label and then you can follow that in the gut, in the tissues all the way up to the brain if that's what you're interested in. But if you don't want to provide an exogenous signal, how do you get how do you have that same tracking capability? And so there was this discussion of genetically tractable microbes, either under or over expressing something or using these privileged substrates and whether or not we can I think the the idea was labeling the substrate and then following that through the bug and then through the host, is that right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Rosa Krajmalnik,,"I think so. I think Tom also mentioned that if we could um identify a specific substrate that will stimulate a very specific microbe then, right? Is that what you said, Tom?"
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Rosa Krajmalnik,,"Right, shuttles. You have shuttles also. You have molecules that are shuttles."
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Mark Mimee,,"Yeah. Yeah, so the furthest yeah, there's a couple of them. Um so there's definitely folks in the cancer space that have been doing it for a really long time. Uh there's one company that was uh I I mean active biotics. I think it's been acquired by a bunch of different people so I don't even know what it's called anymore. And there's another one based in Boston uh called Synlogic. Um these are all in like phase two trials, all orally dosed. I know some folks that worked at Synlogic and their clinical trial was giving people a half a liter of bacterial culture at a concentration of like 10 to the 11 CFU per mill. And that was approved by the FDA. So it's like really high dosing of bugs going into people um and they've had good phase two results I think or phase 1A phase 1B sorry, phase two results and they're moving forward from there. So"
2021_04_23_MND_S10,Elizabeth Bess,,I see it too.
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Yang,887.0,"Yeah. How do we study them and how do we set up our system, you know, to ask the questions."
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Rosa Krajmalnik,,So some of you mentioned um pathogens when you describe what you do. So I guess pathogens are sometimes a very good uh I would say system to study some of these interactions. Any thoughts? Hi David.
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Rosa Krajmalnik,,"Sorry, sorry, Lawrence David. I I'm going forward. I know who you are. Can can you introduce yourself really quickly, please?"
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Nandita Garud,894.0,"And the host is yet another organ or organism that could be having interactions with the players in the system. So um I mean one could treat it as the environment, but could we also just treat it as yet another player in the system?"
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Rosa Krajmalnik,797.0,The the nutrients come in different packages and in different shapes and that will also change the microbiota.
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Carolina Tropini,919.0,"And I think it's it's interesting. I I don't know the the literature very deeply, but it's interesting that some neurological diseases such as Parkinson's seem to not be present in germ free mice. Um, so you know, potentially the microbiota could be giving a a negative effect, but imagine it also the the opposite is true."
2021_04_23_MND_S8,Rosa Krajmalnik,722.0,See you in a second.
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Yanjiao Zhou,54.0,"Uh, that that's a very interesting point. Uh, I guess uh, if we have two, for example, two omic data side, one it's uh, all the bacteria species in the gut, the other one it's uh, stum, right?"
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Shikha Nangia,156.0,"I I agree with you, Erin. Uh, the success of pattern uh recognition is going to come with big data. And I see what you're saying, you know, in if you are talking about personalized medicine, you need to know a particular patient's uh in detailed uh, you have you have to have detailed information to say, okay, this is what we need to cure this disease. Uh, and so yes, maybe the bottleneck is getting that big data right now because the tools of artificial intelligence are getting developed in other fields, not uh microbiota, but they will become available once we have the data that we need. So, uh, the I think in this question identifying uh the species is the bottleneck right now. I think there might be solutions past that bottleneck."
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Shikha Nangia,385.0,"And then start analyzing the patterns. That can also be useful if we have this kind of thing, we can also then use it for disease models like Aaron was mentioning that uh if you recognize this metabolite uh that means it is coming from this particular bacterial species because we've seen it over and over again in different. So it's a hypothetically big uh you know, wild idea, but I think we need to grow that database of uh which bacterial species is responsible for uh a particular metabolite and then the interdependence because I'm sure one uh one kind of bacterial species affects the other."
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Ashley Ross,,You mean like methods to detect neuropeptides?
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Chris Windey,515.0,Okay.
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Aida Ebrahimi,240.0,[low confidence]
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Aida Ebrahimi,300.0,"Of course, those approaches are needed to as a standard to compare with, but if we want to see real time what is going on, then those sensors can be integrated or embedded in that in vitro or in vivo model. Of course, it needs to make sure for in vivo it's going to be more complex, but there are methods that you know, I think we have experts uh in the whole uh panel in the whole uh team that they can work on it."
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Barbara Bendlin,235.0,"Yeah, could could you add that to point one? Um, the idea being start with germ free mice, add microbiota and do metabolomics."
2021_04_22_MND_S1,Shikha Nangia,252.0,So.
2021_04_23_MND_S4,Sarkis Mazmanian,,"There are there are some technologies that are more much more sensitive than than Eliza's or bioflex now, right? Like Samoa and and others. Um, but they don't get to your question or your point which is which is important as well. So part of it is sensitivity, part of it is like is is, you know, the temporal aspect of this, right? And and and knowing when and where certain cytokines are, you know, so now I'm thinking more broadly because again of these"
2021_04_23_MND_S4,Sarkis Mazmanian,,relevant dopamine that's being released. Um and so if we can get those those types of sensors for cytokines and and neurotransmitters and multiplex system in a tissue and I think that would be
2021_04_23_MND_S4,Sarkis Mazmanian,,"you can essentially do, you know, gene expression, you can do transcriptomics but in fixed tissue, right? So you know where when you know, not just when but where the cells in the fix. But you know, which cells are are are, you know, producing, you know, the transcripts of interest."
2021_04_23_MND_S4,Sarkis Mazmanian,,"It's inconceivable, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Jaeyun Sung,1096.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Will Ludington,954.0,So I I totally agree and the serotonin is the one I always like try to track it down but again it's not my field so I would really be curious to know if there is solid evidence for that.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Elizabeth Bess,1103.0,"Um but I don't yeah, I wonder does anyone know um how that might play back into synapse uh formation or transmission of of dopamine um as a neurotransmitter?"
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Sarah MacEachern,932.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Rosa Krajmalnik,977.0,So.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,1019.0,"Okay, so."
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,1021.0,Okay.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Rosa Krajmalnik,1112.0,So.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,1139.0,Okay.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,708.0,"Gallium. Okay, yeah. I don't know about that. That sounds"
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Lisa Osborne,1121.0,"And so that means that there is something going on and then what are the next steps for characterizing and understanding what those differences mean. Um there was also some talk about biogeography, so local versus long range effects, whether or not things are happening um in the gut, so neurotransmitters are being produced, whether or not it's being produced by the microbe or by the host, um how that's influencing physiology and whether or not that's uh like I said at the local site or if it's something that is gaining access to the circulation and then crossing the blood brain barrier to influence what's happening behind uh the barrier in the CNS."
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,1175.0,Good.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,996.0,Some antibiotics are siderophores.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Mark Mimee,1095.0,"I mean, I've had a couple conversations with some folks at the FDA and it actually seems like the FDA is much more risk tolerant than the EPA. So I think the um, I think the thing is if someone's sick and they're going to die, uh there's a lot more tolerance for trying to save them in whatever way possible, even if that means introducing an engineered bug. Um, and for most of these engineered bugs, there are a number of either kill switches or oxytrophies that are put in to make sure that they won't get released. Uh, but usually the concern there is like it's fine for the person, but after they excrete it then where does it go? And that's where the EPA gets in and that's where the concerns uh really are. And also for the ethical dilemma of like, well, you could spread a microbiome from one person to another if you're in the same household and even if person A is sick and is perfectly fine with eating an engineered bug, but you know, their brother or sister or spouse or kid is not and it transfers to them, then they've been unknowingly dosed with a drug. So there's definitely some ethical um issue there, but regardless it seems like, you know, they're trying to grapple with the the ethics both on the environmental and the medical side of that and it's all moving forward uh at least from my opinion. It's not something it's something that should be figured out and not something that should be necessarily a bar to the field in general."
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Jaeyun Sung,663.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Thomas Mansell,711.0,"There's an entire subfield of synbio, right, that's all about kill switches. I mean, as a necessity for the field to continue, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S13,Jaeyun Sung,867.0,"You know, rather than the conferences we're used to, we just listen and just listen to talks, you know, talk by talk by talk and hopefully get to ask questions, but this was really fun and very good creative exercise. Um, thanks for all the facilitators, Emily and Rosa for uh you know, helping us with organize everything."
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Erin Longbrake,1038.0,And also something that may be manipulated by different immunomodulatory medications that we use for treating our disease states.
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Mei Shen,665.0,"Let me see. Google Drive. Yeah, it should be 55."
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Maayan Levy,972.0,"So you can think about it in as the microbiome inducing IL-18 on interic neurons and from epithelial cells. I think the the relative contribution of each is is at the moment unclear. Um, but then IL-18 will induce the the antimicrobials that will control the microbiome back. So there is this bidirectionality in that case."
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Mei Shen,1085.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Maayan Levy,,"And probably for many of these metabolites, the question is why like why the bacteria are making it and why do we even need to sense it? Um yeah. It's I think one of the example is uh succinate and tough cells. What what does it mean that that uh that succinate is present and and and is being sensed? It's yeah just just one example but there are many more."
2021_04_23_MND_S12,JP Yu,,You kind of get the idea.
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Judith Eisen,,There isn't a cell that doesn't use glutamate.
2021_04_23_MND_S12,Robin Voigt,,"So like a bute, even though the the quantities in the brain are are so low, I don't know if it's actually having an effect, but maybe it's changing the gene expression in a cell and causing it to change the production of um glutamate or, you know, reuptake or something like that."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Barbara Bendlin,792.0,"I if I can ask you what I hear you saying is that the the biomarkers won't necessarily represent specific pathologies say like alpha synuclein or or amyloid or you know, one of these one of these abnormal proteins, but rather it will represent uh a dysfunctional mechanism that could then be targeted."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Sarah MacEachern,402.0,"Because like whatever it is, I don't care, but I want to know what it is so I can try to help them, right? Or like how do I test the child's like, okay, they're six months old, their microbiome puts them at risk for brain dysfunction, you know, before they can tell me, before I can, you know, that I can intervene while their brain is still developing."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Kai Zhang,599.0,"So that ruler, that's the uh well that's a that's that's a really good way to to study uh microbiome and biomarker. So do people try to use a cohort of for example uh a cohort of disease patient, a patient with disease, neurological disease and then compare them using this transfer the human fecal sample transfer the germ free animal."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Elizabeth Bess,760.0,"And so what we are doing is saying, okay, with that sort of like starting from here and then they're working backwards, how can we start from the bottom and work work towards the middle. So what we want to say um what we're doing is saying, we have a a very um precise mechanism that shows how gut bacteria are specifically triggering alpha in this instance. But um and then move that system into germ free mice um and ask now they're notobiotic now they're colonized to ask like does this um specific state induce alpha aggregation to a greater degree in the intestine of this animal versus another animal. And I think that's the first step and then I think it allows you to then go back to the humans to say, okay, we found this thing that is an early um at least it can push a system in this direction, can you go back to the human population now and say, well was that actually more prevalent in humans in early stages of disease. Um, and then kind of like cut like go back and forth between those two is how um how we've been working on that."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Cesar de la Fuente,575.0,"Uh just looking at what molecules have been discovered before and then testing them and seeing if we can detect those bacteria by sensing those biomarkers. And so we're kind of taking it one molecule at a time, one bacterium at a time and starting to build up our knowledge on based on that."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Mei Shen,,"Oh, can you see the slides or still not yet?"
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Kai Zhang,,"And then starting from disease and then identify the specific feature of the microbiome or going up from the microbiome's metabolite or proteins, it can also affect the neurological state. So."
2021_04_23_MND_S5,Cesar de la Fuente U Penn,306.0,"Yeah, new technologies for in vivo and real time sensing of biomarkers."
2021_04_23_MND_S9,Harris Wang,920.0,"I'm Harris Wang. I'm an uh Columbia University at the Medical Center. Um, uh my lab is focused on developing new genetic tools for to engineer uh microbiomes and uh understanding the spatial temporal organization of microbial communities um in the gut. Um, and uh yeah, we're we have some emerging interest in in trying to engineer um some of these probiotics uh for gut brain um modulation."
2021_04_23_MND_S9,Shikha Nangia,611.0,"Many disease models depend on which metabolite we are interested in. And so if we are talking about communication between the gut and the brain, I feel that the gateway is the cells and whether it's intercellular or intracellular would be very important to know."
2021_04_23_MND_S9,Shikha Nangia,739.0,"Yes, that can be done. But the question is that the metabolite library is vast and which one are the key ones that we are interested in. Uh and which ones have a receptor, known receptor and which ones don't. So those questions are unanswered and that's what I was trying to steer the conversation towards is are we interested in looking at how this communication happens and through which pathway. Uh and if it's through the blood or not. Because I was also hearing the nerve nerve interactions which I'm not aware of much of it. So that that's also that distinction there, like which is the blood driven one and which is not."
2021_04_23_MND_S9,Timothy Sampson,892.0,"Yeah, that's something that we're seeing in our spinal cord injury models. And so after at least in mice models when they when they're injured, it's they lose some enteric neurons. And so there's this drastic slowing that happens of of gut motility. But what is interesting is the microbiome then doesn't change until so that slowing happens really early with two to four days and then microbiome composition doesn't shift until two weeks later significantly. Um and then really solidified like four four weeks later. But so so there's definitely that top down effect that's happening to shift the microbiome. But it doesn't necessarily mean then that that new microbiome's composition doesn't then affect the affect the host in some way."
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Barbara Bendlin,,Contact multiple people taking notes.
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Barbara Bendlin,,"Thanks Cesar. If you want to just take a minute, we're reflecting on using microbial biomarkers and how they could be applied to disease. And so if you just want to write down a few thoughts in the next minute or so and then we'll get started into the discussion."
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Elizabeth Bess,797.0,Yes.
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Erin Longbrake,614.0,"Well, I think it depends on which disease you want to study. It's so it's not going to necessarily be the same for every disease state. So I think if you're looking for early stage disease, you want to find a disease that has an early phenotype. So if we're going to pick Parkinson's, you might take people who have the sleep disordered um that precedes Parkinson's disease and you can start there and perhaps look at gut metabolites, you know, oral metabolite, pick your pick your specimen of interest that you want to compare that to healthy individuals, uh people without that patholo that uh early sign of neurologic pathology. Um and and go from there but human stuff is great for kind of getting a big picture and getting clues as to what direction to go in. It's very very difficult to do causality until you start going into the mice and dishes."
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Mei Shen,805.0,"Oh, can you see the slides or still not yet?"
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Mei Shen,952.0,What is the right model?
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Cesar de la Fuente Ureña,755.0,"Yeah, new technologies for in vivo and real time sensing of biomarkers."
2021_04_23_MND_S2,Kai Zhang,870.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Carolina Tropini,605.0,Hello.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Abhishek Shrivastava,651.0,Matt can be our facilitator.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Abhishek Shrivastava,653.0,Ha.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Wenjing Wang,827.0,Um.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Carolina Tropini,,"I was thinking more on the psychological stress. That's nice to there's both sides. Yeah, like is is it uh stresses and I feel stressed out today or is it uh uh heat stress uh oxidative stress uh osmotic stress or all of them."
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Carolina Tropini,,It very much depends on uh what causes the increased flow. So like if it's something like um an osmotic uh laxative that will cause a mechanical change. But in some cases if it's a muscular change that causes a increase in flow that um it's at least like from from our research it seems to uh affect more the residence time. So like fast growers will be able to take advantage of the fact that they can keep up before being thrown out. Um but if you if you add the like the change physical environment that can change things a a lot. But either way like it really modifies the the.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Carolina Tropini,,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Abhishek Shrivastava ASU,,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Chris Whtibey,,"Yeah, I've been thinking a fair bit about um pH stress. Obviously that being related to the to the vaginal microbiome but also the gut, you know, sort of you're talking about the gastric microbiome, H pylori can thrive where lactobacilli would not, like they would die. So trying to think about what what ways we can use to study, I guess in a more high throughput way what the impact of different conditions on these different taxa are. Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe. Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess I'm trying to run through that."
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Chris Whtibey,,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Xin Qi,,"So in my lab we actually profile the um we use the unbiased proteomic and genomic analysis to profile the proteins and genes which uh in the gut uh in the Alzheimer disease mouse model. Uh it turns out it's really time dependent age depend those protein change uh no matter protein level and gene change, those actually are very age dependent and the species dependent. Um and I I I guess also depends on the institutions ARC condition. Um that is what I thought so we really need to define the model system and then uh actually profile this based on the model system and figure out the profile the signaling pathway."
2021_04_23_MND_S15,Silvia Ronco RC4SA,,Okay.
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Timothy Sampson,959.0,"I'll piggy back on that because I also while I'm I'm pretty biased that I do think we'll be able to find some things with the microbiome being able to modulate outcomes, I fully agree with this chicken and the egg issue whereby the disease itself is likely undoubtedly causing changes in the gut that is then potentiating some change to the microbiome composition. And so changing the microbiome composition almost no matter how we're going to do it is likely going to have those top down signals that are still detrimental and still selecting potentially for this this pathogenic environment within the gut. So we we have to come at it potentially from from both angles."
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Maayan Levy,1069.0,"I think that's a super intriguing perspective. Sorry, go ahead. Um, no, I just think that the use of germ free mice is is probably um a key to this because you can you can induce disease in germ free mice and then colonize the the mice at different time points after induction of disease or before and see if it has if it plays any role with the, you know, the the regular microbiome and the modulated one."
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Stavroula Hatzios,952.0,Thank you.
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Harris Wang,697.0,"Yeah, there's some additional approaches where you can for example engineer a strain that it you know accesses exclusive, you know, dietary component that, you know, other strains might not for example like some, you know, polysac injectable, you know, uh polysaccharides um and so that you can give this engineer strain more benefit."
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Elizabeth Bess,785.0,Yes.
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Emily Balskus,880.0,Congratulations.
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Lawrence David,914.0,"Yeah, I think Tim had a really nice point about that which is that these diseases often include a a feedback loop, right? And so you might even have to hit the host and the the microbiome simultaneously."
2021_04_22_MND_S7,Emily Balskus,1009.0,Oh.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Linnea Freeman,600.0,available you can buy on the shelf and are going to say that they're going to improve your microbiome but I don't know how much that's really going to have an impact versus something like having to take antibiotics in the opposite direction.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Marie,817.0,"Yeah, there's been a few studies that have uh described that. So in the majority of of women of course um it doesn't happen across the board in the same way. It does return quite rapidly back to what it was before. Um and this is quite rapidly after birth and and the changes that characterize pregnancy start happening in the late second trimester. Sorry that's my dog that needs wants to come in. Um and especially in the third trimester and in general, most of these changes um are what in other studies could be associated what some people may call a dysbiotic um microbiome. Um but but like with many things that it is speculated to be an an adaptation to to to the state. It's also associated with um a microbiome that has been linked to obesity so it's is hypothesized to favor the the harvesting of energy to sustain the pregnancy or to sustain a healthy pregnancy."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Rosa Krajmalnik,,"bacteria doing what we can measure that function is more important than just diversity. Diversity I in my mind doesn't mean that much. We want to know which microbes are important if there's any that are important, how are they interacting with each other and how are they interacting with their environment."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Robin Voigt,,"I don't know, but I'm really intrigued by you know, the way the microbiome is formed when you're young. Um whether it's through birth or maybe a traumatic event when you're a child, we know stress changes the microbiome. Um, you know, there've been a lot of studies by um in the Deneden cohort where these children who have stressful events, they have accelerated aging. Um, so something is perturbing the microbiome when they're young and then you sort of need to get stuck there. So I guess the question is how do you change that once you're stuck in this maybe pro-inflammatory um, you know, environment to make it healthier. And you know, I'm interested in the idea of exogenously maybe giving different bacteria that, you know, produce a lot of maybe like a butyrate or some other short chain fatty acid or an indol or something like that. But I don't know that we even know enough which ones to do. It's probably going to take a lot of animal studies to do that. Most interested in the idea of a fage to maybe knock out a bacteria that is bad, but again, I don't think we know enough about what's a good microbiome and a bad microbiome. So how do we even start? Is there some like model disease where we can try, you know, we know a lot about the microbiome as a place to start."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Ali Keshavarzian,,"We uh long term uh uh fixed diets is a good representation of the human, which is not coprophagic at least not on deliberation. It is not nocturnal. He has a very wide range of gene background and we know gene microbe interaction is profound."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,David Durgan,821.0,in rats.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Lisa Ryno,1014.0,"Um it seems like, you know, C Elegans would be a really easily controllable system to start narrowing down um, you know, perhaps individual or or um small interactions among, you know, populations of a few bacteria. Um and and being able to sort of modulate that. Um the the other thing I was thinking about was actually more about the um kind of approaches or um I don't know, uh treatments that that could happen and I I wonder if if also looking to the cancer literature would be beneficial. Um I I know that there have been a number of cancer study or studies um sort of in in um oncology fields about how chemotherapies for example affect patients microbiota over the course of, you know, X period of time and um, you know, we know that they don't actually completely obliterate them, um they they do definitely damage and change them. Um but there are longitudinal studies and I I kind of wonder if looking also to the chemotherapeuic realm or even um non chemo but um radiation is a is a possible different type of um application that could could be changing the biome."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Mark Mimee,,"Um and then I guess the last point I want to make was a lot of this stuff that we've been talking about is everything that exists within the realm of normal biology. Uh thinking that like, oh short chain fatty acids or bile acid metabolites are things that the microbiome does to interact with the host. Um but we could also think of using the microbiome as a drug delivery agent where if we can engineer these bugs to make molecules that aren't normally found in humans but could have therapeutic value, that could be another means through which we can engineer the microbiome and again that gets you out of the realm of trying to understand this complex ecosystem and interspecies interaction, but rather just thinking of more traditional drug design where we have a molecule, we want to deliver it and we're going to use bugs in order to make this molecule in situ and that might have some beneficial effect."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Ali Keshavarzian,,"The study that you uh mentioned and is published red shows any long term may not be the case. The very two very good studies in uh infants that they use probiotics to modify atopic march show that is extremely effective but long term microbiota community was not changed. But maybe that we don't need to have a long-term graphment. We may need to just break the cycle, change the microbiota in a transient way to then get the beneficial uh uh long-term functional effect. What do you guys think? Do you think that we need to push hard to get a long-term graphment or just a transient one?"
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Nandita Garud,650.0,Yeah. Absolutely. It's uh four pages so I thought I'd take note locally and then we can put this in the PowerPoint.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Nandita Garud,821.0,"Yeah, I know. I appreciate it very much. I didn't know where to start so I thought I'd summarize."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Mark Mimee,899.0,That idea might fit well into the five that you have where you were talking about your test tube to human continuum.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Nandita Garud,987.0,I'll put it in the PowerPoint.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Robin Voigt,647.0,I think it is to record.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Rosa Krajmalnik,,Okay.
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Ali Keshavarzan,,You work with Jean Chang or you don't work with Jean?
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Ali Keshavarzan,,"Oh, go ahead."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Ali Keshavarzian,,"No, no, that is what was told that I give everyone one minute uh to put some one liner that what they want to do. I I assume all of you guys read the questions that you have to um discuss."
2021_04_22_MND_S6,Linnea Freeman,,"Um and the last just thought from triggered from these um comments is I do use antibiotics to cause severe dysbiosis and then try to see what's happening in the brain because of that. And um in that case, antibiotics do have a huge impact and we give them in the drinking water for for mice for six weeks, so they're constantly getting antibiotics, but if I think about um, you know, for my kids or something with ear infections and all the antibiotics they've been taking, it's just amazing to think about how static our microbiome can be in general and then those early life exposures to many rounds of antibiotics and how much that can perturb the system."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Errington,,"50, okay."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Errington,,"So so your comment is is to define what is maybe if you think specifically on on, you know, small molecules produced by by gut bacteria and or maybe um host induction of small molecules by the microbiome, right? So so you know, the comment it just understand correctly is is to define that repertoire as an initial step so that we know at least what the players are and then that can inform potential responses, right? Now I know people are doing that um and people have been doing that for for some time. I think that there's always more to learn. Um, I think some of this literature goes back even a decade or more. Um, and I think a lot of this is based on small molecule detection, right? Um, but people like Jeremy Nicholson even more than a decade ago were measuring molecular outputs from the microbiome in mouse and rat models and and some human systems as well. My understanding and and you know, Kai and I think others may know more is, you know, that one of the bottlenecks um is detection, right? And identification of small molecules. We generally, you know, I know mass spec technology and other technologies are improving quite rapidly."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Ashley Harris,,"Or is it important to look at dynamics of how they're signaling? Because that that can dictate what technology you choose. So I mean, and I think both are important. Um, so I guess when you're defining the messengers, it's like do you want to look at it like a snapshot in time of like all the different messengers that are um present?"
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Melanie Garces,825.0,Can a bacterial metabolite have an impact on the ENS that then signals to the brain and can it also separately get to the brain and have an impact. So is it one or none or is it potentially multiple?
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Harman,868.0,"But that that that's the that that mediates the effect versus the fact that again, in this one isolated case that that we know a little bit about, you know, the percentage of the molecule that gets in the brain is a fraction of what's circulating in the body, right? And so there's much more of these metabolites that are still in the gut and in the rest of the body than the brain. So you know, to your point is that it could be doing the same molecule can do one thing in in one tissue and a different thing when it arrives in a different tissue, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Norman,674.0,"And if you think about, you know, all the different ways to transmit that signal, you know, immune cells have serotonin receptors, right? And so Oh man."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Norman,872.0,is it is it dampening inflammation?
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Norman,902.0,Correct.
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Tanya Nguyen,927.0,"Right, I think DBS would be a really interesting study because you can kind of change the amount of stimulation, turn it off and then potentially measure, you know, activity in the enteric nervous system or changes in composition over time. I'm not not sure of that. Um I'm I'm a neuropsychologist so I've worked with a ton of patients with DBS and show improved cognitive functioning over time and um I imagine it would might improve GI function, but no no, not sure of that."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Thurman,643.0,"Yeah, I think classically they're all motor neurons, so all like motor responses, what you're saying, motility and contractions. Um, but yeah, I I I wonder if there's more and I, you know, even just the the fact that everyone knows where you know, 90% of the of the directionality is afferent from gut to brain and there's only 10% of the fibers that are brain back to gut. It really makes me wonder if there's more actually diversity in the sensory signals that are going in and actually less communication back um down through that path. Um, either that you don't really need to communicate back to the gut and it's mediating some other non gut response. Um, or yeah, or maybe the communication in the efferent direction is not through the fibers and it's through immune or molecules instead. So, yeah, I know these are kind of naive thought like very high level thoughts when I I I I wonder um about that."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Thurman,794.0,"I I just so after Ashley Mitchell, I just remembered a study from a couple of years ago where they gave six hydroxydopamine to the substantiagra in the the in mice and the mice had constipation. If I remember correctly. I'll I'll dig up the paper right now, but so maybe that there there there are some examples, right? Again, how that's mediated I'm not sure. Um, but that that encompasses brain to gut, right? Because the lesion was was in the brain."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Xun Zhang,981.0,Actually Vegas are coming from the brain stem.
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Marcum,693.0,is this is there adnergic signaling?
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Marcum,895.0,"So in in the chronic stress paradigms, was it corticosterone that led to these changes in it was like the molecule corticosterone that led to the changes in transport or you or is it some other system and you're in parallel measuring the stress response? Um, I'm just wondering, you know, is is is corticosterone that that molecular handle if you will connecting the you know, you know, GI effects."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Marcum,975.0,"You feel you feel in your gut, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jeff Brian Marcum,1147.0,"You feel you feel in your gut, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jarrad Horowitz,865.0,"I don't know if there are differences in dietary habits, something that you know, or something again that you wouldn't have to study in a clinical trial, right? Um, you know, using molecular techniques. But I don't know if that's if if people have like, you know, looked at populations or individuals where, you know, people who meditate or mindful versus those who aren't, you know, what do we know about their immune or GI systems, right?"
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Jarrad Horowitz,971.0,Kai is the Kai you're muted. Uh you're the reporter.
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Kai Zhang,995.0,"54, yeah."
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Melanie Garami,1192.0,Okay.
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Xun Wang,878.0,54.
2021_04_23_MND_S14,Xun Wang,897.0,"Yeah, that's really good. Great chat."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Judith Eisen,541.0,"are all these other associated microbes with many, many more genes that are influencing the process from very early stages of development. And uh, you know, it's it's cast a whole new light on the developmental process and I'm someone who believes that the developmental process sets the organism up for the kinds of things that are going to happen later, such as the kinds of things that that uh Bob has talked about. And so we're uh in my lab also interested in interactions between the microbiome and other tissues, um uh and the nervous system. So in the gut, we look a lot at immune cells in the gut, and in the brain, we look at microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain. I don't know the best way for people to introduce themselves because we probably all have uh each other in different places on our screens."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Maayan Levy,753.0,"I can go next. So um, I'm Maayan Levy. I I'm from Upen. I joined uh Pen three years ago. I did my PhD at the Whiteman Institute in Israel, um, studying innate immunity and the microbiome. And my lab is focused on understanding the communication between the host and the microbiome, specifically the interaction which is mediated by epithelial cells. Um, and we are focused on understanding how microbial metabolites are being sensed by the host and what are the downstream consequences of such sensing. Um, so we are trying to identify the function of unknown metabolites and and on the host side, we are trying to identify new receptors that can sense these metabolites and we use different tools like germ free mice and different transgenic models to to knock out these receptors or potential receptors that we have identified to understand these these communications better."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Robert Bryan Jr,,No one? It it's an honor to be uh a scribe. I got to assure you.
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Timothy Sampson,,"Yeah, so I think at least in the case of Parkinson's disease, we're at least our group is leveraging a lot of the existing human data that's out there to understand those microbes that are most closely associated with the disease state. And again, at least with Parkinson's disease, there's a a plethora now of of samples. So on the order of thousands, I think now that have been sequenced pretty deeply. So we can see not just associations and the presence or absence of particular microbes, but actually enrichments and correlations with different aspects of disease severity, uh things like the constipation phenotypes that happen in in these patient populations. Um, things like severity of the motor symptoms, uh rapid we don't quite have progression yet. Um, you know, PD is is a pretty long disorder that takes a long time to progress. So to my knowledge, we don't have that sort of temporal resolution, but we do have sort of that um cross-sectional uh resolution of of disease severity."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,JP Yu,734.0,Yeah.
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Robert Bryan Jr,938.0,"But what bothers me is that in these pathological states, there tends to be a leaky gut barrier."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Michael Burton,1025.0,"Uh, so that's a good question. I I don't know of any any any, you know, studies either that have that have done that. But uh the a couple studies that that I was referring to that that have shown um direct interaction are um interaction between uh bacteria and um neurons were uh some studies done at Harvard uh from a Harvard group where they saw um there's a particular receptor this uh hemolysis receptor HPR, I forget the the name but there's a specific like the bacteria directly interacts with the the sensory neuron. Um and so I'm sure there's, you know, metabolites and and obviously other parts of of the bacteria like um the the cell wall that also directly interact with uh sensory neuron as well. Uh but yeah, I don't know the answer to the question though. That's a great question."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Irene Yang,825.0,"They've I think they've found herpes virus pretty that's the kind of the latest um uh buzz in the literature, but bacteria as well."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Timothy Sampson,909.0,"But I don't think we know and if anybody else knows correct me, but I don't think we know how that inflammatory signal is potentiating those outcomes in the brain. And so I think as Michael was alluding to or or talking about, you know, there's this signaling aspect of the uh the peripheral actual neuron activities like the Vegas nerve that could be changing uh in the face of inflammation locally, but then something that's more systemic, maybe it's it's actually just the cytokines that are passing through the blood or signaling through the blood brain barrier or cell invasion, immune cell invasion uh that's triggered by those systemic inflammatory events."
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Michael Burton,1021.0,[interruption] Sorry.
2021_04_23_MND_S3,Robert Bryan Jr,1089.0,"So uh no, but given that everything is leaky in a germ free mouse, um I I just think it's going to be all over the place. That's my guess. We know the blood brain barrier is disrupted."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Lingyan Shi,877.0,"Yes, Lingyan."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Kevin Cash,1107.0,"So we make uh polymeric nanoparticles that have small molecule indicators and sensor components and recognition groups and reporters inside the organic phase of the nanoparticle itself. So the nano material is the most boring possible nano material. It has no special properties other than yes, it is small and hydrophobic."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Joyoni Dey,954.0,"Thank you. Um yeah, so I am associate professor at LSU. I've been here for like I think this is my seventh year. Um so the yeah, I work on like like uh unfortunately not in a like uh at a much higher resolution like a I mean clinical resolution. So I work on um mammography. So I one of the things that um I'm working on is uh building a face contrast X-ray system for uh you know, finding the microcalcification clusters um quite early even before the tumor is developed. And so um so uh we hope that um the three like I uh have that innovation phase image and the um the uh what's it the the scatter image small angle scatter it's a coherent scatter scattering process. So um so uh so basically uh interferometry and um uh so and then I also work on neutron interferometry. So uh neutrons have a lot better penetration through bone and um so the so or metals, you know, so basically the interfaces are much clearer and it can be also have it can also be operated at very high resolutions. So I have a collaboration with NIST um to work on that. So I'm building a new um MPG like a modulated phase grating system which will hopefully give them the you know, scatter lens from 10 nanometers to like orders of magnitude. So you know, like the uh you know, the correlation lens. So that's hopefully what we can achieve. So one of the ways that maybe I can we can potentially talk about is if the nano like basically small small angle scattering images of the nano nano materials or something something similar. Um and I also have worked on spec, you know, single photon emission tomography. So but that has a tracer as you know radiation radio tracers and um so I don't know if that's so relevant for the label free."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Wei Min,679.0,"You know, yeah, I think you know, we don't have to, I mean, as a as a group, we don't have to restrict ourselves to, you know, to, you know, strict label free. I think using some sort of uh uh clever labels or nano structures or this kind of is certainly a interesting direction to explore."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Sapun Parekh,937.0,Go ahead.
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Wei Min,674.0,"So there are different type of uh Raman microscopies for the regular like spontaneous called vocal Raman, it's uh diffraction limited and also uh very susceptible to tissue scattering. So uh it's probably on the order of 50 to 100 micron. And uh for non linear Raman that uses uh uh near infrared light uh to coherently excite the molecules, the penetration can probably go down to 500 micron uh 500 microns. And there's a uh a different type of Raman microscopy, it's actually not microscopy, it's more like a tomography, it's called the spatially offset Raman spectroscopy. So they use uh uh they use light to propagate and then use a different and move the excitation source to to measure the propagated light again. So from the different uh light propagating back through the tissue, they can infer the depth information. So that has substantially uh deeper penetration. It's probably on the order of millimeter to centimeter. But uh but again, by doing so you lose spatial resolution. There's always a trade off between spatial resolution and the penetration. So so that type of Raman spatially offset Raman has the highest penetration depths of maybe centimeter, but the the spatial resolution is relatively poor."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Ed McCleskey CZI,1064.0,So.
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Wei Min,1161.0,So right here do we already have a good idea now? It sounds like we have use we can use a neutron scattering to couple with heavy water for biology imaging?
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Lingyan Shi,630.0,"So the the flow um actually it's about like fluid fluid mechanics inside the interstitial tissue and when the extracellular matrix change under certain disease. Okay. The fluid or we say the interstitial fluid inside the body will change their flow flow rate or something that we can we can trace. It's difficult to image water directly. So I think this is a good method to look at the water itself directly, not the solutes in the water which is not the case for for water itself."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Lingyan Shi,701.0,"So that bulky fluorescence probe perturbate the the function of the nano carrier or nano particle and the diffusion coefficient inside the tissue or in the vasculature system or even come across the the blood brain barrier or some other barriers in the vasculature system will be also altered the permeability and the diffusion coefficient will be altered by this bulky size. So if we add and single atom like deuterium attach a deuterium on the nano carrier or nano particle. Then it's still it's still a original maybe just like original size, maybe a little bit heavier but original size. So still we can consider it a label free technique to to visualize the drug delivery across any vasculature or cell membrane or vasculature walls or in the interstitial even in disease status or tumor. So we can we can image them directly."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Lingyan Shi,899.0,Actually the contrast arise when the cell have the metabolic activities and incorporate the deuterium atom into protein lipids carbohydrates DNA RNA. So this is just like non carbon source uh water which is participating the metabolic activity.
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Lingyan Shi,650.0,"Yes. Yes, so what about have a certain percentage of of heavy water inside the drinking water? So we provided 25% in the drinking water and let the mouse drink for days."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Joyoni Dey,931.0,"Okay, so that's that has this other clean image for the uh coherent scattering. So you know that may also be like a we'll have the attenuation but if that's totally overwhelmed by the scatter and we cannot correct it easily then we can try to look at the um phase image and the uh scatter like small angle image scattering."
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Mini Das,949.0,Oh I I can type uh in that.
2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Sapun Parekh,964.0,Anybody can type.

2021_05_20_ABI_S5,Joyoni Dey,790.0,"what do you mean the energies? So usually this will be thermal neutrons or cold neutrons. So it's it's a very different calculation as you know, so it's like."

Yeah, and you can take the notes, you don't have to put the notes into the PowerPoint yet, you can take those, share it with people, they can add and then can condense them into the PowerPoint so that there's one slide."
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Shannon Quinn,778.0,I'm I'm unfortunately on Zoom on an iPad and taking notes on a desktop with the monitors right behind it.
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,819.0,Or do you want someone to
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,840.0,Um
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Ulugbek Kamilov,1151.0,"And by the way, anything like changes like this you just mentioned that pixelation changes. Those are the systematic things that you could in principle incorporate to this as non-trainable elements or adaptable elements of machine learning models."
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger UChicago,1076.0,"That's one of the they asked us what do we want? We want all the data and we you you there technically we could do a lot. We are limited by data and culture I would say. The giving of data, the sharing of data even."
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,722.0,"so and that's what I think I meant by technically all we can do a lot. It it it it we're in a very technical field and we're hindered by data and culture. Um, your other question even in um cellular images, many of you are in cellular. I don't know you talk about your experience there and I'm going to ask Alex about that, but you have to people sit and circle cells. crazy just to create data and that gets back to bullet one. How many cells do you have to circle to have enough data to algorithm. Um, but yes, the crowd sourcing it does it does exist, but it's it's not on a massive um scale. Good point, Jim. And sorry I didn't see your hand ready. So I'm used to this, not the stationary one that they have on. Alex."
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,885.0,"Why give the AI raw data? In a way, you're you're training in files, the training of all these humans has they have been reading images for many, many years. So how many of you in a sense consider what image am I giving to the AI and do you sometimes do the preprocessing to help the AI learn because you have limited data?"
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,821.0,And I I think the example of giving the AI algorithm an image that radio humans find easier to read could save you a lot of training time and data when you're doing your AI. How many of you train on medical images? I think Katie does and Shannon and Shiva.
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,951.0,Right.
2021_05_20_ABI_S4,Maryellen Giger,869.0,"The other type of AI is in general you can think of it as statistical, you know, it's the deep learning, it's um uh having the machine actually learn and I personally believe that in the future we need a mixture of these. I think it would be extremely interesting to have like um both types applied to your situation Girgis because you have you know, a lot of times it's hard to find the person with the model. You know, it's um but how do you want to bring that point up in this this Google Doc?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Ying-Hui Chou,681.0,Hello.
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Abhishek Shrivastava,726.0,Matt can be our facilitator.
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Abhishek Shrivastava ASU,889.0,"And then the other project in my lab is on the type nine secretion system where we and this type nine secretion system is found in a large number of bacteria of the phyla bacteroidetes and we try to study, you know, how adhescence and certain enzymes are secreted by these, what are the stressors or sensors that regulate the secretion system and how that might uh result in changes in the structure of the community. I have, you know, my office hours are going on for my teaching right now and have one student waiting on a zoom call. So I might just float away for the first five minutes, so please excuse me for that. Okay."
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Carolina Tropini-UBC,1160.0,I was thinking more on the psychological stress. That's nice to there's both sides. Yeah like is it is it uh stress is in I feel stressed out today or is it uh uh heat stress uh oxidative stress uh osmotic stress or all of them.
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Carolina Tropini,1013.0,"It very much depends on uh what causes the increased flow. So like if it's something like um an osmotic uh laxative that will cause a mechanical change, but in some cases if it's a muscular change that causes a increase in flow that um it's at least like from from our research it seems to uh affect more the residence time. So like fast growers will be able to take advantage of the fact that they can keep up before being thrown out. Um but if you if you add the like the change physical environment that can change things uh a lot. But either way like it really modifies the the membership."
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Chris Whtibey,767.0,"Yeah, I've been thinking a fair bit about um pH stress, obviously that being related to the to the vaginal microbiome but also the gut, you know, you're talking about the gastric microbiome, H pylori can thrive where lactobacilli would not, like they would die. So trying to think about what what ways we can use to study, I guess in a more high throughput way what the impact of different conditions on these different taxa are. Um might be one way to start to get a handle on this because I guess from what I'm what I'm gathering from the conversation is there are just so many different types of stress, so many different types of stress response that we're thinking about that we need to kind of start to define, okay, which ones do we want to look at, how do we look at them? Um which is all its own kind of question, like how do you define which which stress is the most important on a microbe? Oxidative stress seems like a reasonable place to start just based on leaky gut and what we know about oxidative stress and um metabolism, but I guess that's what I'm trying to run through that."
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Chris Whtibey,855.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Xin Qi,675.0,"we actually use the um Alzheimer disease mouse model, we use two mouse models. One is over express APP mutation, another is APP knock in transgenic mice. We can we can definitely see the different difference between the proteins, we can definitely see the protein database between the two species and we pick up if we pick up the one model, uh we we we we did the bioinformatic analysis. We saw a lot of metabolism, amino acid disruption and the the regulation and uh ferroptosis and the uh in the autophagy related cell death and the endocytosis related uh the signaling pathway they all change uh in the AD in the context of the AD versus white type animals. And I think now we just focus on one of this pathways to manipulate. definitely we need to pick up the good protein, the good candidate to manipulate those uh the signal pathway."
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Dr. Ali Keshavarzian,1055.0,Okay.
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Aida Ebrahimi- Penn State U,1220.0,"So another thing I was wondering, um, I mean they are hidden, but I don't know if we specifically talked about them like mentioned them at least here. So, um, you know, when the um host is under stress, like when we are under stress, so we know a lot of biochemicals in our um like in our saliva, for example, uh it is changing and we can measure them. Like, you know, when our cortisol level is changing, our um um hormones like I don't know, epinephrin is changing. Um, so and those have effect in in terms of um changing how uh microbes they proliferate, right? So there is really a connection, but I don't know if we really mention them anywhere. They are a stress response of the host, right? And they can modulate bacteria or perhaps other microbes as well."
2021_05_21_ABI_S16,Abhishek Shrivastava,995.0,"Well, I think of it like, you know, making a mutant in rabbit doesn't really work straightforward in mice. So it's same way we have different species of bacteria with different genus. So what works in E doesn't work in. Second is a lot of the traditional method rely on homologous combination and the selection is antibiotic resistance. So we just don't know what sort of antibiotic resistance profiles certain bacteria have once we have to grow them in the lab to do all of that and then we have to figure out which plasma can go in and which plasma can integrate and things like that. So those are the challenges. I this just needs more effort, more volume of effort. Like the initial E methods were developed using phages actually by and other people. Um and so, you know, people just need to be more motivated to do it."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Carolyn Bayer,970.0,"Um but still have good spatial resolution and it's generally seen as real time or close to real time. Um, so again, not fast enough to see some of the fast cellular molecular dynamics, but"
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,747.0,good examples where you really do need high temporal and spatial sampling to solve some kind of problem.
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,829.0,"Yeah. Yeah, and I've heard that argument a lot but but the transition between FMRI and functional near infrared spectroscopy you can get fast sampling with functional near infrared and but you get much much better spatial sampling with functional MRI."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Seu Sim,909.0,"So you just install that for marker to allow you know, super resolution imaging but not having to sacrifice, you know, endogenous dynamics of biomolecules and I'm not really sure if it's possible but I want to know if you have thought about it."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Katharine White,1033.0,"And so for all of those questions, how they're interacting what why when as well as disease versus normal, you maybe have different approaches or different constraints on on the need for temporal versus spatial resolution. So um but that that um that question of of how do you set up your experiment or how do you set up your acquisition to to capture the biology, to capture these dynamics, which I think, you know, in the next 15, 20 years is going to be where a lot of uh at least molecular scale uh microscopy is is focused. So"
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Katharine White,1076.0,"And just to oh sorry, just to follow on that, I think one of the other important things is that for a lot of for a lot of this, we don't really know in disease whether the interactions, the partners are changing,"
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,626.0,"Uh MR tools, macroscopic optical tools, are there other tools we're forgetting?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,976.0,"Okay, okay. Well we'd be nowhere without somebody who did designing molecules, right? So that's good."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Katharine White,707.0,"Yeah, yeah, and it's I think in the next five to 10 years that's going to be moving forward a lot, but you know, the in, you know, if we take a look at like light sheet microscopy over the last five to 10 years, that's gotten used used all over biology now, but one of the issues is that you see something in in the light sheet or you see something at this kind of organismal or kind of millimeter to 1 millimeter to 20 millimeter scale and then identifying which areas or which regions are important or significant or that you might want to go into more spatial um higher spatial resolution approach takes a ton of data analysis to get to, particularly for dynamics that might not be as globally visible on the light sheet scale is like a developing zebrafish embryo or developing drosophila embryo, which are beautiful morphogenically, but if if you're interested in potentially like um manipulating or controlling or or studying in a on a single cell scale."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,808.0,"I think we still have half an hour, I think."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Carolyn Bayer,941.0,"I shouldn't say scale, but what what mechanism you're interested in imaging, right?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,847.0,"Yeah, computational um I mean this is certainly a big paradigm in surgical guidance world is computation computationally combining data from different modalities to help guide imaging and therapy. Um, where you might have just a static structure image guiding your temporal treatment or temporal acquisition."
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue-DARTMOUTH,960.0,Mhm.
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Brian Pogue,680.0,Okay.
2021_05_21_ABI_S1,Carolyn Bayer,842.0,"And um method of moving between those time and space skills and then integrating orthogonal or multimodal where you would then you know, so demonstrate it sort of on on the small scale on a single imaging system."
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jeff Douglas Winkler,984.0,75 minutes.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Carolyn Bertozzi,1052.0,Those questions are just to assist you with the discussion.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Lingyan Shi,658.0,"Yes, Lingyan. Okay. So um I'm just arrived at UCSD as an assistant professor in bioengineering department. I was trained as a biomedical engineer uh for my bachelor, master and PhD. And also in the postdoc training I was working in uh when Dr. Way Ming's lab. And uh we were developing the uh SRS stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and we combined with the multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to visualize cellular metabolic activities. So um for my background, I think I combined the biological questions and also the um optical imaging technology together to um utilize this uh subcellular resolution imaging technique to visualize um the metabolic activities in cells and tissues or even live animals. So very nice to meet meet meet you meet you guys today."
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jeff Wheeler,915.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jeff Winkler,640.0,"But the question is, you know, yes, when we say in vivo typically you cannot really do any labeling with human, but uh, you know, clinical setting, you can extract all those bodily fluidics. You can get blood, you can get urine, you can got other stuff. Those stuff once you get it, you can do whatever you want."
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Lisa Poulikakos,988.0,"So so following up on uh and Minnie's points, I I've also read some studies that are showing that exomes are actually exomes or similar particles are actually very effective scatterers due to their relatively large size. So they can actually they have pretty clear scattering signatures that can be used to mark them um in a label free way. and this has been shown in microfluidics, but there I think Minnie's point really comes in that if you want to image this in vivo, then you'll have, you know, in the depth of the body, many multiple scattering effects. So how can you filter those out in a clever way um for instance getting rid of background signals um and there for instance there are some studies that use uh nanoparticles that are up converting. So for instance you excite them with infrared light which can go deeper into the tissue and they emit fluorescent light. So so there are um some approaches like that to address the depth issue as well."
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Joyoni Dey,664.0,"And also if we are I know you you are looking to answer better biological questions but they asked us to think beyond you know whatever is so what about neutron interferometry for these kinds of things. It's I can send you a potential paper, you know if people are interested in looking at it. It's alternative method and it has lots of complementary things to x-rays. So just one of like one of the papers I'm sure there are other many others. So for biological just just wanted to throw it out there that some of the methods have automatic you know like the one of the advantages of interferometry is that you're getting coherent scatter and it's undiluted with the long angle you know the blurring mechanism."
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Joyoni Dey,834.0,So.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Lingyan Shi,854.0,I see.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Bill Mccleskey,872.0,We have a reporter but we just in the middle of uh a very interesting discussion.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jeff Squier,953.0,I don't know how long if you be human heavy water.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Lingyan Shi,1002.0,But in the core center of the tumor they have a lower metabolic activity. So we can visualize that heterogeneity by looking into the the CD signal and uh different concentration of the chemical bond tells us the metabolic uh heterogeneity.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Bill Mccleskey,1037.0,the signal could definitely last for days.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jyoti Dube,712.0,So you know that may also be like a you'll have that intion but if that's totally overwhelmed by the scatter and we cannot correct it easily then we can try to look at the phase image and the scatter like small angle image scattering.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Jyoti Dube,730.0,I can type.
2021_05_20_ABI_S8,Lisa Satterthwaite,810.0,"Yeah, yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Sixian You | MIT,903.0,"So what my lab does, uh we want to tackle this issue and also a lot of other like imaging speed or contrast issue from three aspects. The first aspect is uh um multiphoton imaging. How can we uh design different wavefront shaping or pulse shaping or even light engineering, light generation techniques to enable deeper penetration of the light. Uh that's one aspect. Uh so we work on label free imaging technologies and also just uh uh common multiphoton coherent image coherent Raman imaging."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Sixian You | MIT,1018.0,I can hear you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Sixian You | MIT,1052.0,I can hear you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,740.0,"Well, I I mean, I think there's more and more different kinds that are starting to be turn key. We have tried to get uh a couple of big companies to license our patents and they wouldn't. And then we just turned rogue and are doing everything absolutely open and just trying to help people build their own. And I've had some pretty involved discussions uh with people at this meeting that are starting to build our systems. So it may go beyond, you know, the labs that build those things uh purely."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Aniruddha Ray,1126.0,"Uh sure, I can do it. I'm in four and also in seven though. So it's a bit rigged."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,634.0,"But if you think about you know, broadly light shaping applications, I think would be would have been a better word to put there because light sheet to me it means that you rely somehow on camera based sensor imaging, but light shaping applications are super broad and can rely on point detectors as well as camera based imaging and any kind of sensor that you want. And that's where I think there's a lot of engineering uh that relates to depth where you have to kind of think separately about excitation delivery and then also uh as as as Sishan thinks about a lot also getting back that information out somehow."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Brad Smith,1050.0,Well that's quite impressive two to three centimeters that uh that's um.
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Barbara Smith,974.0,"That they'll place in and they'll um release a vacuum and then that tube will be removed manually. And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so, um, how we um re I I would say, um, reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding areas. We can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature, um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds. So they're doing acoustic information anyways."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Sixian You,1173.0,"on scattering property, right? So if we know the signal is there, can we use ultrasound to confine the signal there, to modulate the signal and then to get the signal back. So I think that could be very interesting and uh I need to learn more about uh Barbara's research on electrodes as wave guide uh sounds really fascinating."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Alexandra Dickinson,725.0,"Yeah, and plants, I mean, one way people use plants is is like for phytoremediation. So plants suck up the toxins and then degrade them is the idea and then release, you know, the degraded bits into the atmosphere so it's safe. So but you could also think of that as a way to monitor, you know, in the shoot system or in the leaves, you know, what what what, you know, not necessarily toxin but what's in the soil? What's what's happening?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Luke Mortensen,820.0,"I mean, I talked with uh Henrietta and Jazz yesterday about something kind of related to this, you know, if you have some sort of like liposome carrier or something, you can have multi component um where they're like, you know, permanently co localized um reporters where you can, you know, perhaps use your photoacoustic imaging to be able to identify a location of interest and then have some kind of fluorescent tag associated with it as well. Or maybe even one that, you know, could allow you to do single molecule or whatever, you know, whatever else you want to do. Um that seems like it could be like a cool way to that. I mean, I just I can't think of very many or any any examples of that, but you know, it's not my area of expertise, but."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Brad Smith,914.0,"Yes, I suppose there is lifetime imaging. Does anybody here work in lifetime imaging? I mean is that is that a technology that would work at a deeper tissue as well?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Carolyn Bayer,1037.0,"Okay, let's let's try millimeters first or or half a centimeter. How about half a centimeter?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Sixian You,1056.0,"So wave front image uh engineering uh I I'm not sure if I'm talking about the same thing as Carolyn because wave front shaping in the microscopy can only get us uh probably from like uh 100 microns to 500 microns. That that is already really good. Um in that region wave front shaping means um so um when you are looking through the fog, you cannot see what's behind the fog, right? So that is because scattering. So the light travels in. So even if you have perfectly aligned colmated light, it scatters everywhere. So wave front shaping tries to compensate for scattering. So it kind of predicts how the light scatters uh from all these heterogeneous particles and then it kind of uh sends in this pre-aberrated light, which means it already have these uh uh compensation. We call it phase conjugation. Basically the opposite effects of the scattering that's happening in the tissue so that when this light travels through this fog or scattering tissue, uh in theory they are supposed to be canceled out and uh so what you eventually get is that it's uh it's you you use this wave front engineering to turn this opaque tissue into transparent, optically transparent tissue. So that's kind of the concept."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Brad Smith,704.0,"Well, we'll just become 3.4B or something like this."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Brad Smith,757.0,"So yeah, especially light sheet microscopy."
2021_05_21_ABI_S11,Carolyn Bayer,870.0,"So we're obviously not in the same domain as far as spatial resolution. So um and then when you start thinking about how to improve spatial resolution, then sensitivity becomes a problem, you know, as you're imaging smaller and smaller objects."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Richard Weisman,652.0,"And either of those things you can do. If you think they're really valuable to put in the parking lot, please do. You can keep them for yourselves. I suggest Josh take some notes on the side, which he can share with people, and then you at the very end of the meeting you added it into the key points uh for the discussion. And just have a lot of fun in the discussion."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Sixian You,698.0,"Uh slide 22. Okay, perfect. Thank you."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Stefan Wilhelm,635.0,"I'm Stefan, I'm from the University of Oklahoma. I'm in biomedical engineering. Um, I'm trained as a chemist. Uh, now I'm in my fourth year as a system professor and my research group focuses on nanomedicine, so applying nanotechnology for treatment and diagnosis of cancer specifically and we are interested in understanding um the transport of drug carriers and small molecule drugs through the body and how those drug carriers interact with cell surface. So for us super resolution information is is really the key to understand those transport pathways. Um, and my lab is applying techniques such as expansion microscopy to get a better understanding of those intracellular transport pathways."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Kristen Maitland,688.0,"Uzay, thank you."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Aseema Mohanty,899.0,"I'd like to I'd like to kind of jump on that as well. Um I I feel like one thing that I I and this might just be my inexperience with the super resolution field, but like um one thing we don't really talk about much is what and and similar to what Matt was talking about is um what could we kind of learn from, you know, we're kind of used to a a certain type of imaging with an objective with a very high NA, you know, lens and and I feel like that's kind of a bulk of the problem."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Aseema Mohanty,920.0,"Yeah, okay."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Stefan Wilhelm,971.0,But scattering can also be.
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Stefan Wilhelm,999.0,"Yeah, absolutely. Like when uh when you mentioned this, I thought immediately about um assembling um uh objects at the nano scale that as a single object do not scatter but when they come together and form an assembly then all of a sudden they scatter light very efficiently. So this definitely something that that we could could work on."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Kristen Maitland,1127.0,"Yes, I do feel that especially in this virtual format that it does feel like okay, it's your turn to talk and there's a little bit less flow. Um I was wondering if it would be better after the introductions that if each person talk like briefly state what they're interested in discussing and you could almost like group them in and say okay, first we're going to talk about this particular direction and then we'll cover this direction. Um so that would be one thought. I think it's hard because of the the topics are relatively broad actually even though you know, in some ways they're specific, but they're relatively broad and you can approach them in different ways and so it's um it's almost hard to put your ideas into, you know, kind of groups. You know, and when I was looking at this topic I was thinking we could talk about new applications for super resolution that are, you know, it's not currently applied to. We could talk about different um advances to the implementation and then um I was also I was glad to see that there were people from MRI in here that if we could um get some information from other fields in imaging that might influence our approaches. Um but I do feel that each person had something different to add that um it might have been hard to kind of narrow down the topics because they are um there's so much to cover. I think. But I hope that you continue to have your discussions with each other in the different um gather rooms or towns or without you get to be in um so you can continue these uh conversations."
2021_05_20_ABI_S3,Unidentified speaker,643.0,Thank you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Mini Das,592.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Mini Das,601.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,869.0,Cool.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,958.0,Cool.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,807.0,"Yeah, so that's been the interesting part is that if you want to do clinical studies, you have to use clinically approved camera systems which there are more now than there were, but the we've been typically paired with the intuitive surgical robots which have not even that great of a camera system on them. Um so the dyes have to be quite bright. Um and the problem is if you want to, you know, it'd be great. we're looking at like ratiometric imaging next to be able to get um, you know, a more precise read and more quantitative. The problem is is then you got to go back and change all the clinical systems and there are now, you know, 5,000, 6,000 robots around the world. So there's definitely an instrumentation issue. Like where the image the the issue is the cost is really high for the camera systems. Um so it's really hard to get a company like a big company like Intuitive to move on something um unless there's really a clear clear benefit because they're going to have to go back through the FDA process and go modify out all their instruments. Um but it can happen. It just has to be really good."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Mini Das,1051.0,"Uh so this came up while we were talking about neutron imaging and somebody said yeah, heavy water could."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Allison Dennis,778.0,I don't think
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,989.0,Okay.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Allison Dennis,618.0,"we were talking about thinking of luciferase was you can have a set of cells that is expressing the luciferase we're excited about swear imaging and so the contrast agents you only see the swear emission from the contrast agents that are you know, adjacent to the the cells that are the cells of interest. And so with with specificity, you know, it could be that the contrast agent is actually effectively targeted where it's supposed to go, which would be ideal. Um, but the other half of it is that you if you only see some portion of the contrast agent, is that good enough? What is the you know, when does the off target contrast agent become a problem?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Girgis Obaid | UT Dallas,1089.0,"Sorry, go ahead."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,909.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,911.0,Um.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Fanny Chapelin,918.0,Um.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Aniruddha Ray,1069.0,Okay.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Aniruddha Ray,702.0,"is it as the tumor grows, what happens is that it outgrows your vasculature and so it starts to have a different type of metabolism. And so there is a accumulation of lactic acid in the tumor tissues."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Aniruddha Ray,771.0,"And so we do ratiometric imaging to figure out the pH. So what you can do is you can create a calibration curve externally. And one of the good things about nanoparticles is that these fluorescent dyes or any kind of dyes, they are protected inside the matrix."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Dylan McCreedy | Texas A&M,863.0,there has been a lot of nanoparticle uh optimization that that has sort of cell type specificity as well too.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Mini Das,885.0,And I was AAV was uh.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Fanny Chapelin,896.0,associated virus.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Matt Bogyo,1023.0,"And so um in this case, you're really only looking for potentially large changes in a small population of your probe. Um, so it helps a lot when you have not that much like for example protease present and you you you can you can get a good contrast out of it. It's just it's it's a high background because you have a lot of free probe around."
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Girgis Obaid | UT Dallas,717.0,I think the general rule is simplicity and I I think that's one going to be one of the biggest issues on the contrast agent development side.
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Girgis Obaid | UT Dallas,725.0,Which would which would wash off fast?
2021_05_21_ABI_S6,Brad Smith,844.0,"I will tell you this, just as uh if you want to type in MRI contrast agent Gadolinium, I can guarantee the first five pages of Google are lawyers wanting to take you on for lawsuits to sue the companies that made the contrast agents. So uh it's a very tortured field to ever think you're going to have success in the end."
2021_05_21_ABI_S7,Melike Lakadamyali,599.0,interesting regions within your sample um that uh are are are actually interesting to further look at higher resolution sort of zoom up to those and do that in a fully automated way uh with a sort of intelligent type microscope. Um so those are my thoughts.
2021_05_21_ABI_S7,Douglas Shepherd,858.0,"I mean, I think those methods are getting a lot better. Um, they're very similar in spirit to the also different views for QPI. So, so either way you're talking about somehow combining something that has a different view of the image to then try and reconstruct it in 3D, right? The nice part about the QPI is it gets the refractive index and that's still a bit tricky to get with a light field setup. So, um, yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S7,Melike Lakadamyali,633.0,"I mean, for what I mentioned, I think you do need an automated sort of machine learning guided approach. A user guided approach is usually too time consuming and you know, um low throughput again. Um and so you need something that um, you know, can integrate hardware with like recognition of what the image is telling you to guide the hardware um to the right field of view to the right focal plane. Um and change between objectives, right? Going from low magnification, low NA to high mag, high NA. Um and and then, you know, focusing and zooming into the right spot and changing modalities of imaging."
2021_05_21_ABI_S7,Melike Lakadamyali,761.0,"So, I mean, I guess just to give you an idea, right? When we do high resolution imaging because we're using 100x objective, um our field of view is very limited, right? Um, and so the throughput is very low. We image one cell at a time. Um, now with a CMOS camera is again very increasing a bit the field of view and the throughput, um but it's a couple of cells at a time. And that um, you know, limits you in terms of um, you know, if you have rare populations in your sample, will you ever sample them um in your imaging if you're only imaging 10 cells in and again it's a slow imaging modality, you image one cell in every uh, you know, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, um something like that. And so, um, you know, one approach is again like make it automated so that you can image um thousands of cells um automatically. Um, and again randomly sample or maybe a more sort of intelligent approach would be uh maybe there are low resolution features that, you know, um mark those rare populations that you can um find um with a higher throughput approach then you can assume it to those with high resolution uh right rather than just randomly sampling and hoping you will find one of those cells in your in your image. I don't know if that uh answers your question."
2021_05_21_ABI_S7,Lingyan Shi,761.0,"So if the the image stack, the hyperspectral image stack have for example uh 512 multiplied by 512 pixels and each pixel have its own spectrum information covered. And that allow us to do computational algorithm to do clustering, clustering out the same similar spectrum groups of the pixels. So if group one have this same Raman spectrum, then these pixels will be assigned to uh for example red color, one color. And group two, we we cluster out again and we assign different second color. Uh then there's no limitation as long as we can group out uh a group of of spectrum profile, we can assign a color for that specific group of molecule. So the the in the end, each pixel, there is a dominating molecule signal. Dominating molecule signal is um the the the final assigned color."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brad Smith,641.0,"Um, obviously some people are very passionate and very expert about this, but but this is also an opportunity for somebody who maybe hasn't who's thought about this area but really hasn't thought how they could get into it and suddenly maybe there is a way that they can get into the game. If they first of all just we know what the question is. Um, you know, where are the technology gaps or and uh, you know, obviously the big one that immediately comes up is we have a clinical set of questions and a pre-clinical set of questions."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Fanny Chapelin,763.0,"Yeah, that's one of the big issues in MRI. You can see subsets of cells, but you can't get to the single cell level."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mark Sellmyer,1030.0,"Fluorescence, yeah, it's a fluorescent mark on the cell surface of of neighboring cells that have walked by."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mark Sellmyer,1150.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mimi Sammarco,1152.0,"The emit um I don't know if you guys are familiar with it, but it's it's amazing. It's uh basically you just flash freeze a mouse. Um you'd have to have some sort of signal in it. It'll do I mean you can you basically you turn an entire mouse into 20 micrometer sections. And so what it'll do is it's this giant knife that comes across and shaves off these cryo sections of this mouse. And then it'll it'll image and then reconstruct the entire whatever you imaged into a three-dimensional it's like an Ivis but with way, way better resolution than an Ivis. So"
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brian Pogue,1197.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mimi Sammarco,1198.0,So
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mark Sellmyer,1210.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mark Sellmyer,1231.0,"Oh, that's"
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brian Pogue,797.0,"Um, I don't know, why don't we just start at the top of my screen like Fanny, any have you any experience with single cell imaging?"
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Ping Wang,1172.0,Of course you can test with the the I mean test the blood glucose tell okay if these cells function but some cells probably they are not like um I mean fully functional but they still alive so probably that's a window for you to do some like rescue treatment.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brian Pogue,1188.0,So.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Allison Dennis,1049.0,It's in the Google folder too.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brian Pogue,1053.0,"Yeah, you can share your screen and then we can all sort of talk through it I guess."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Crystal Rogers,604.0,"Oh, I didn't see the spreadsheet."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Crystal Rogers,675.0,"Well, that that's relevant too, but no, I actually meant um well, yeah, I guess that's relevant acquisition time, but also the amount of time that it takes between when you give the epitope or the treatment or the marker and the time that you're then going to image it whether or not that gets diluted or lost or attacked. So there's two different time issues."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brad Smith,861.0,Okay.
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brad Smith,663.0,"The problem with metabolic probes is that the cells have to be metabolically active. So you know, in the bacteria, once you get biofilms and the things calm down, then then really they're not taking up much stuff and so they get harder metabolic probes struggle that way then."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Mark Sellmyer,727.0,"I think they're going after, you know, cell specific markers that are on the surface using things like immuno pet probes where you've got an antibody that's specific for that."
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brad Smith,679.0,"Shwet, do you want to be the reporter?"
2021_05_20_ABI_S2,Brad Smith,693.0,You have to fill in slide 27.
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,David Van Valen,705.0,Uh imaging done in such a way that the images can be converted into some numerical um format where the numbers actually have meaning. Um that's probably probably closest I could I could I could give you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Arnold Hayer,740.0,"Maybe maybe I can say contrasting to to qualitative imaging where you just look at morphology, shapes and you know, describe them in in in a in a non non numerical form, quantitative imaging would would be to to convert features or intensities into into numbers so that you can make them make those observations or the you what you detect comparable between experiments between cells and conditions."
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Maryellen Giger UChicago,778.0,I
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Maryellen Giger UChicago,1125.0,Uh.
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,David Van Valen,762.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Qian Liu,1143.0,So I want to make sure the uh the purpose of the scoring.
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Qian Liu,909.0,"Yeah, yeah. Unbiased unbiased interpretation."
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Sapun Parekh,975.0,"Yeah, we put out a data set very similar to that in the last year doing exactly that segmenting nuclei and and cells for people who want to develop algorithms because we are not good at that to actually try to do that."
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Maryellen Giger UChicago,990.0,"Right, I'm going to agree with you and I'm going to go to Matt Lew, but I wanted to say that even in medical imaging, even though it's standardized."
2021_05_21_ABI_S10,Sapun Parekh,873.0,Thank you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Dr. Anna Moore,644.0,"Um, in the beginning of my career, I used uh iron oxide nanoparticles as contrast agents uh to detect tumors and now we're using them actually as uh carriers as vehicles to deliver therapies and as imaging reporters as well, that's why it's image guided therapy."
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Sixian You,978.0,42. Okay.
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Mark Sellmyer,1005.0,"It's a great question how to image the matrix. There aren't great tools as I understand. Maybe someone else knows. I think there's some MR techniques and someone MR might be Molly can jump in and correct me but I think there are ways to look at like higher how hyaluronic acid or you know, things that are around but I I don't know too much that's um specific to ECM like imaging collagen. I mean, I guess the other other techniques that come to mind are like MR elastography that's like Yeah and and ultrasound sort of stiffness measurements."
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Benjamin Bartelle,672.0,It's some reason it's okay to put in millimolar amounts of Gadolinium into a person.
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Benjamin Bartelle,892.0,"We know that this drug goes hits T cells specifically. Great, we're building a theragnostic that's going to find the T cells and report back to us that it's done a job in it. So we have there is a way of bypassing some of that initial safety testing if you do go with these um biologics or just antibodies that are already approved. So there there's some hope there and I think the as we get better and better at this, we may start building out something like a grass list, you know, it's like generally recognized as safe list."
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Sixian You,995.0,Companion diagnostics.
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Molly Bright,1031.0,"Um, so that's that's my domain would be the brain, that's unfortunately what I can focus on. But there are so many drugs that I think sit into this category and if you think of all of the mood disorders and anything to do with mental health, anything to do with long-term degeneration of neural function uh and and dementia."
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Mark Sellmyer,1132.0,"Right. So so efficacy as measured by some um, for psychiatric disease."
2021_05_21_ABI_S8,Benjamin Bartelle,732.0,"Yeah. I mean that's what we mean by multimodal, multimodal imaging."
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Melike Lakadamyali,786.0,"Yeah, I agree with you on that. I was actually thinking about when Gokul mentioned AI based, you know, high density tracking. I feel like and this was one of the original questions I think in the PowerPoint, how do how many things do we need to track to be able to, you know, extract information about interactions. But the challenge there is again, I'm thinking from like the bias of tracking individual proteins, um this relies on sparse labeling. So you're labeling maybe 1% of the proteins that you're tracking. Um and then you label 1% of one protein in red and 1% of another protein in green, even if they're interacting, how do you really know they're interacting if you only label 1% of each um population."
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Katharine White,1082.0,For label?
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Jin Zhang,636.0,"Potentially, there are some molecules that could be tracked by itself, right? Or or or or identified by itself based on some unique property, then that will still give the molecular identity and the um kind of label free metabolites, you know, as Ellen mentioned a little bit and some of the sugar molecules. Uh so label free could be for some molecules with molecular identity."
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Jin Zhang,795.0,"Exactly. if no um additional, you know, topics we could summarize."
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Domenico (Nick) Galati,938.0,I mean.
2021_05_20_ABI_S1,Katharine White,971.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Mimi Sammarco,914.0,"So we predominantly use microCT to look at bone growth and then of course the way Crystal does, you know, we do IHC and um looking at antigens and protein expression completely separately in two dimensions. You know, we don't get very good quantification. Um, and so we're interested in kind of like melding those things together."
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Shannon Quinn,1063.0,"Yeah. Yeah, quantitative imaging."
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Mimi Sammarco,638.0,"Oh, individual sections. Like even if you're a parent, you're not even Z stacking it, but just being able to get a better feel quantitatively in a predictive way through space that way, right, HC."
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Melike Lakadamyali,926.0,Absolutely. I think the super resolution field is a good example of this um you know because our data actually not even intensity based. Um it's points in space and um you know we've gone through this like um uh phase where we were um um trying to to convert our images into intensity based images um but there a lot of problems with that and you know like the quantification again was very dependent on how you converted it into an intensity based image etc.
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Samuel Achilefu,1057.0,"Yes, go ahead, Katie."

2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Unknown speaker,647.0,I don't see anything new.
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Samuel Achilefu,638.0,Can you all see the program?
2021_05_21_ABI_S13,Shannon Quinn,717.0,Melika?
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Benjamin Bartelle,719.0,"Hi. Uh I'm Ben Benjamin Bartel. I'm assistant professor just started this year at Arizona State University. I work on uh molecular tools for MRI. My goal is to uh non-invasively resolve and manipulate the neuroimmune system. So I do that with a combination of um uh just direct MRI methods uh through um just image analysis and I also build a host of molecular tools using directed evolution, signaling reporters, direct molecular sensors, etc. all for MRI and all in vivo."
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Sixian You,1042.0,All right.
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Crystal Rogers,907.0,"I was going to mention the same paper. Although somebody commented that the mechanism of formation was different in vivo versus in the organoid, but that the function was similar. So I do think there are limitations, but I think multi-disciplinary studies where you have people in vivo and you have organoids and then you are able to, I mean we can't study people, but you can do um patient specific therapeutics, right? So pulling cells or um or tumors out of patients to try to determine in their physiology if they can respond to these things. You kind of have to have all three because without them you're you're running blind in some areas."
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Mark Sellmyer,1034.0,"It's a great question how to image the matrix. There aren't great tools as I understand. Maybe someone else knows. I think there's some MR techniques and someone MR might Molly can jump in and correct me but I think there are ways to look at like higher how highly hyaluronic acid or you know, things that are around but I I don't know too much that's um specific to ECM like imaging collagen.

2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Sixian You,1028.0,Companion diagnostics.
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Molly Bright,1105.0,We need a time scale of looking at what a drug does and what happens in the absence of that drug in the face of huge human variability to evaluate if we're remotely close to getting after what we're after.
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Benjamin Bartelle,766.0,"We don't know if the Alzheimer's models are accurate. We don't know if the Alzheimer's plaques that you see are anyway like related directly to Alzheimer's in humans. Uh human patients often have Alzheimer's plaques. They often have Alzheimer's plaques and no Alzheimer's. They sometimes have no plaques and Alzheimer's. So it was enough it was enough to go on where the animals model animal models worked. So it's worth pursuing because they were getting good data here and they could see their imaging biomarker in humans work. But it turned out or I mean the case is still they're still making their case. There's they're other companies based on the same amyloid hypothesis still testing the same thing. There may be some condition where it works, but as yet it it does not work."
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Benjamin Bartelle,677.0,"Longitudinally, I've I've had very little success with that. If you're trying to look at something over months, the chances you're going to find that nanoparticle laden T cell or that nanoparticle laden, you know, stem cell and have it persist over the months you need to follow the disease progression or therapy progression. Like we've been trying that for a long time since before I started grad school and it's just without having that genetic persistence, it hasn't worked."
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Benjamin Bartelle,982.0,Or it needs to be uh an engineered cell that uh is detectable and then can change its its signal or shape. You need to have that level of complexity to have a theranostic.
2021_05_21_ABI_S4,Dr. Anna Moore,601.0,"Uh,"
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ferdinand Schweser,912.0,And uh my more neuroscience based research interest is in brain iron homeostasis. So I really focus on techniques that uh can specifically quantify brain iron. Uh I also have a second head I'm technical director for the imaging center um and there we develop um PET MRI hybrid techniques for pre clinical world and uh pre clinical MRI uh cell tracking and um and clinical MRI too.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ferdinand Schweser,789.0,"Yeah. but billions went into the development of the technology. You have to pay $7 million or something to get such a technology and then the only application that you find is uh cardiac triggering basically or I mean I I'm there are not so many applications actually where it's essential. And and if you just think uh motion correction is the application for pet MRI, okay, maybe, but I think when people started integrating the technology, they had much higher hopes for it."
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Uzay Emir,1016.0,Yes.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Uzay Emir,595.0,that it is it is the it is it's providing unique opportunity to see these things at the same time with optical imaging and that provides useful information and MRI and you can pinpoint really important features together with that. So I I don't think the technical wise it is it is pretty open if we use the devices as appropriate as possible.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Maryellen Giger,978.0,Or do you fuse at the feature level that you've brought out about something which you can do at multiple um things.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ferdinand Schweser,1088.0,"And then you could use the MRI and look for the same pattern on a spatial scale and then basically predict from that again the pathology throughout the brain or see where you have a similar pattern in the brain. So you go basically across scales and combine really the methods um because if for example if you would do microscopic technique of whatever neuron firing or something, you could image only a certain a very small percentage of the brain and you can only relate you can only correlate MRI say uh with the microscopy technique at that special location."
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ping Wang,1166.0,"So so if you can get MRI and predict the histology, that's going to be a"
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Maryellen Giger UChicago,712.0,"ultrasound or something. There are different types of heterogeneity, but it's that heterogeneity keeps popping up across scales even though it's heterogeneity of different things. So I think you guys are on something here."
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ulugbek Kamilov,626.0,So.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Maryellen Giger,691.0,And then there's also the um part on um uh which is related to the cost is the uh socio economic situation in which that uh imaging system uh might uh not be able to exist.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ellen Sletten,873.0,"Well, I think we've sort of touched upon it is the molecular information, right? That is the early signals that we're going to be able to read out on. So how can we think about doing that in a cheap, non-invasive way that would allow more screening."
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ulugbek Kamilov,1025.0,I think we should brought that by fuse or guide or make it separate.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ping Wang,648.0,I talk to the CEO of the MPI producer in United States. Actually there there are two major company one is magnetic insight based in California and the other one in Europe broker. I mean they don't they don't do the hybrid now but there's a group in Europe they trying to combine these two together.
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ulugbek Kamilov,697.0,"Shiva, we don't hear you."
2021_05_21_ABI_S5,Ulugbek Kamilov,956.0,"And somebody check on the slide, is it only me who sees it or?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Ulugbek Kamilov,663.0,I did it right before.
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Uzay Emir,930.0,"And you do get the information and you might find some corresponding things non invasive imaging modality coming from MRI, path contrast or whatever you do think. And then you do get since it is already open for histological analysis, you can take the pathology and do do DNA sequencing and do do so this dimension reduction is coming from that because there will be a massive amount of data is coming. So then one of our colleagues during that discussion suggested that to tailor the optical imaging to certain things and then this enzyme enzyme specific uh optical imaging or it can be tailored. I'm not an optical person, so I'm not an expert, so I really don't want to make uneducated uh assumptions, but that is how that uh tailored approach come up. Am I right Blueberg? So am I missing or"
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Brian Pogue,1110.0,"from MR scan like through an endoscope or something. Um, optics is tough though, right? Because either it's diffuse or it's microscopic."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Mini Das,1125.0,So the
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Ulugbek Kamilov,1158.0,Because of the
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Joyoni Dey,1050.0,"Yeah. X-ray scatter, I know that they have some in the clinic like prime by, you know, Siemens. They have already for mammography at least even for the projection and assume they have to assume something about that equation, so they assume like a water mu, like average attenuation to for the correction of the scatter."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Joyoni Dey,1091.0,"So they don't have that much scatter. But my system to preserve the dose, I'm not using that um analyzer. So I will now have to correct for scatter and the scatter is in the the zeroth harmonic, the in the attenuation image, not so much in the uh small angle scatter or the, you know, or the phase image."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Benjamin Bartelle,977.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Mark Sellmyer,990.0,"MRI is there an application where contrast agent is not required? Yeah, I would say probably only maybe 20 to 30% of MRI scans are with contrast. The bulk of them are meant to um do things like diagnosis stroke requires no contrast. diffusion weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging can can make the stroke diagnosis. A lot of MRI right now is basically anatomic so that stroke is one where there's like functional data coming from the diffusion, but um the rest of them are mostly anatomy. So lumbar spine MRIs to look for whether or not there's a narrowed narrow frame where the nerve is coming out to say that's why this person's having, you know, pain. So they're it's pretty much workhorse anatomic technique with um high end contrast enhancement used for like tumor characterization, infection characterization. Um uh you don't even need it to do like gallbladder, you know, MRCP to characterize the biliary system. So and I think."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Benjamin Bartelle,648.0,For us for for making sensors which are almost exclusively used um just as proof of concept papers and sometimes in model organisms. Those things almost always are administered either like continual IV or being directly infused into the brain or being infused into whatever space they want to be in just because they have they're these macro molecular complexes and the only way to get them to work is to pump everything you need into the spot you're looking for. And in those situations it's almost like there's no reason to do that 3D because you know where you're putting it. It's uh it's almost academic to say that the imaging is not invasive because the delivery is definitely not uh invasive.
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Mini Das,700.0,"No, no, no. I'm I'm taking I'm taking manual notes, but I can't write on the Google Doc too."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Brian Pogue,741.0,Well there's a comment from Mark here too about bottlenecks and rapid analysis.
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Benjamin Bartelle,903.0,"You're not going to use light sheet microscopy to diagnose neurodegenerative disorder in a person, right? But it is an incredible tool for looking at model organisms. It's it takes advantage of just the host of light based technologies we have available and we wouldn't have biomedical research without that. So how do you connect these clinically accessible imaging modalities like MRI where you can't see anything. You can see structures, you can tag a few things, maybe some spectroscopy, but compared to what light can do, it's just the the tiniest scratch, um, mechanistically speaking. So how do you relate those two imaging modalities to get the maximum value from an a a research and analytical modality and a more clinically accessible or clinically relevant modality. I think for me that's that's always been my sort of challenge, uh, coming up as was trained as a as a biologist and then went into biophysics. How do you connect those two things?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Shiva Abbaszadeh,602.0,"Yeah, just like accessing data and then doing more like virtual clinical trial that like I'm really glad that FDA and NIH they started doing that more and more. But then I think more of the like I see the bottleneck is to have a like access access uniformly to data and then by that I mean like as if it should be data set from all the companies, all the like kind of images of those the company, they don't share the software, but um that's why it should be something that it can be standardized across the different modalities and across different, you know, protocols. So that's why I see that in my field that could be a bottleneck."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Mini Das,692.0,"Let's copy and paste to the PowerPoint. If somebody's doing it, I won't do it, so we don't"
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Mini Das,726.0,"Okay, yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S12,Benjamin Bartelle,758.0,Thank you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Allison Dennis,612.0,Hello.
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Katharine White-Andre Danino,601.0,"in single cells in real time. Um, and as it relates to the kind of concepts here, we're interested in understanding how pH dynamics affect proteins, pathways, cell behaviors and we have some really interesting data uh linking initial pH changes with with metabolic reprogramming that we would like to better understand the dynamics of of that cross talk. So."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Jin Zhang,869.0,"Yeah, that actually sort of a um is related to uh one of the uh things that mentioned by different people. I think in terms of looking at metabolites uh or metabolic processes uh what I guess what are the targets, the variety of different targets that we're we're thinking about. I I guess uh summarizing different, you know, different people's uh intro, uh you know, we looked at uh newly synthesized metabolites as a sort of a whole class. Uh specific species um NADH NADH uh or oxygen uh as a proxy or or uh developing specific probes for a very specific metabolite. So uh there these are all possibilities. What are some of the advantages uh and challenges uh of targeting these different things for looking at metabolites and metabolic processes. And as Kevin mentioned uh perhaps, you know, patterns uh features of any of those, right? as a you know, class uh or as a individual species could be used for diagnostic purpose. Just to uh throw the question out there."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Ping Wang,601.0,analog uh GLP one analog uh for the imaging uh to guide the gastric bypass surgery for the type two diabetes patient. So that's another example for the diagnostic um application.
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Candace Fleischer,931.0,"Um children do some sort of genetic screening etc etc. But metabolism is often left out and we know like the prompt is saying, we know that metabolic changes can actually proceed any physiological or structural changes. So from a very big picture imaging metabolism with maybe in the clinic with the exception of FDG pet and some other tracers from mostly cancer, right?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Candace Fleischer,1023.0,"If you allow if your site does spectroscopy, it's it's naturally integrated into every MRI whether you use it or not. You you kind of have to pay extra for it when you're buying your system. So if you didn't do that you won't have it. But um even non-academic sites are using spectroscopy for tumors. Um so I wouldn't say it's routine but I would say for so for example for fatty liver disease it is routine because that's a really great way to quickly sample fat distribution that you really can't see extremely well in the deep part of the liver."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Jin Zhang,730.0,Sorry. I said you don't have to but most people do.
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Candace Fleischer,652.0,Um so you're still using spectroscopic imaging. Um we don't really need to do deuterium labeling for MRI because we already have so much water throughout our body like that would be that would be the heart the hardest most expensive way to do MRI but for spectroscopy um we're we're still looking at the spectrum you're just looking at deuterium versus protons in all of those compounds. Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Kevin Carlo O'Mines,965.0,"Uh yeah, I can share the screen."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Allison Dennis,701.0,"Hi everyone, I'm Allison Dennis. I'm a professor at Boston University. I'm working on self-supervised learning for computer vision. I'm excited to be here and share my thoughts on this topic. I think self-supervised learning is a very promising approach for improving the performance of our models."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Matt Scruggs,834.0,"I think one of the most promising applications is in the area of environmental monitoring. We have a lot of data from satellites and sensors, but it's often unlabeled. Self-supervised learning could help us to learn from this data and improve our ability to monitor the environment."
2021_05_21_ABI_S9,Matt Scruggs,929.0,"Yeah, I think that's right."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Kristen Maitland,905.0,Thank you.
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Melike Lakadamyali,629.0,"And then there is sort of um thing that relates to this group um is um, you know, again super resolution imaging is slow, it's low throughput. Um, and um often again we're looking for a needle in a haystack. So it would be really exciting to have an intelligent microscope um where, you know, you can first look at low resolution, um find interesting regions uh within your sample um that uh are are are actually interesting to further look at higher resolution, sort of zoom up to those and do that in a fully automated way uh with a some of intelligent type microscope. Um, so those are my thoughts."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Matt Lovett-Barron,925.0,"And it's difficult to look at all these with the same method. So I've, you know, worked on some uh approaches to try and register different types of data together so we can look at the same cells under different conditions where we'll look at live uh neural activity imaging in an animal that's behaving and then we take the same animal, we fix it and we do, you know, multiple rounds of in situ hybridization to look at the genes expressed in those same cells using image registration to merge our live brain onto the fixed brain."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Aseema Mohanty,1011.0,"And a lot of our problem is the same as what uh Matt said, um is reaching across, you know, multiple different regions of the brain but being able to do high resolution stimulation um for optogenetics. And so, um one thing that kind of kind of interested me in this topic was um since I am a technology builder, um I'm looking for kind of the the technological kind of in your hardware, what are the limitations um, you know, for for the the whole brain imaging versus the super resolution imaging and is there, you know, places we can kind of push the boundary on temporal and spatial um resolution there."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Douglas Shepherd,644.0,"So I I would like people to step back and think like, what do I really need to answer the question I'm looking for? Like more is not necessarily better in my opinion. And it drives the technology sometimes because like there's a resolution race, right? But it it doesn't mean that we're answering questions better. And so I think some careful thought about what really needs to be quantified across space and time can make a big difference."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Lingyan Shi,862.0,"Then we can image them directly with SRS microscopy and uh, we also see the the calcium calcium signal with G camp based uh genetic mutation mouse, for example, mouse brain. So, uh, at at that moment, we can specially resolve those subcellular resolution of metabolic activities, how the neuron uptake glucose, for example, or sites uptake glucose, how they shuttling those energy to the neuron, then um simultaneously, we see the calcium calcium signal from sites or from endothelium cell, how they behave. And this phenomenon, the interaction can allow us to quantify how does the blood brain barrier permeability change or how it influence the metabolic, for example, the protein synthesis or lipid synthesis and also allow us to really see subtypes of lipids because the Raman based technology have the ability to allow us to resolve and this is subcellular which overcome the barrier um that mass mass spectrum to based imaging system has. And also 3D volume metric, that is the ability that this imaging platform can can solve for the which is surpass the mass spectrum to based imaging modality."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Melike Lakadamyali,815.0,"So I mean, I guess just to give you an idea, right? When we do high resolution imaging because we're using 100x objective, um our field of view is very limited, right? Um and so the throughput is very low. We image one cell at a time. Um now with the camera is again very increasing a bit the field of view and the throughput um but it's a couple of cells at a time. And that um, you know, limits you in terms of um you know, if you have rare populations in your sample, will you ever sample them um in your imaging if you're only imaging 10 cells and and again it's a slow imaging modality image one cell in every uh you know, 20 minutes, 15 minutes um something like that."
2021_05_21_ABI_S2,Mimi Sammarco,665.0,"I I don't want to interrupt uh uh you know, the other discussions was very exciting and interesting. So if I didn't want to interrupt but we can write a line in that and we can talk offline. Okay. I'll message you offline then. Okay, thank you."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Richard Weiner,656.0,"either of those things you can do. If you think they're really valuable to put in the parking lot, please do. You can keep them for yourselves. I suggest Josh take some notes on the side which he can share with people and then you at the very end of the meeting you added it into the key points for the discussion and just have a lot of fun in the discussion."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Sixian You,702.0,"Oh, slide 22. Okay, perfect. Thank you."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Sixian You,836.0,I can get started on one of the topics.
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Luke Mortensen,1163.0,"muscle dynamics, um looking at mitochondria, organelles like that. And also focusing on uh therapeutic stem cells. So for both of those like muscle bone applications, um trying to design MSC therapies and bio manufacture those."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Kristen Maitland,692.0,"Uzay, thank you."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Dylan Burnette,597.0,"So I would say that this this this question goes well beyond what I think about normally. Um, because we're trying to get to structural resolution. And if you do that in an animal, it would be too much data. We don't have big enough computers for that. And so this is a very interesting, you know, concept because when we want to look at an animal, we just cut off a piece of our zebra fish and take that tissue and we call that an animal or an organism. Um, but I I think this is a very interesting conversation, but what will we do with that data if we got super res from an entire animal. Like I'm not even sure what we do with it. And that's what I'm actually scared about that part. I guess when we have a single cell, we're we're also doing expansion microscopy and we're doing structural elimination or single molecule imaging on top of that. And I'm calculating resolution and it's scaring me already."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Aseema Mohanty,1003.0,"I'd like to I'd like to kind of jump on that as well. Um, I I feel like one thing that I I and this might just be my inexperience with the super resolution field, but like um, one thing we don't really talk about much is what and and similar to what Matt was talking about is um, what could we kind of learn from, you know, we're kind of used to it a certain type of imaging with an objective with a very high NA, you know, lens and and I feel like that's kind of a bulk of the problem and I'd like to understand from people who are doing microscopy and and like uh, you know, what are kind of the limitations um from people who are actually using super resolution um with those objective lenses that that you guys use um in terms of I guess field of view and like the amount of power that you need to be able to illuminate an entire section."
2021_05_20_ABI_S7,Kristen Maitland,673.0,"or image at a depth, you know, that maybe you can't reach. Um, and then taking into into consideration your sample that the light is traveling through and how does that in influence or impact your ability to image, whether it be resolution or depth or field of view."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Steve Jett,1209.0,By asking a question about one type of data and pulling relevant information from other types of data like deep tissue.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Sixian You,865.0,"Uh and so there might be a need to develop that technology much, much further on on the optical side to push that to biologist because they needed to be turn key."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,875.0,Hi.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,732.0,"Um, so the more the more colors you can see and the redder the colors you are, this is going to help or are we pretty happy with the genetic reporters that you've got now? I mean,"
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Sixian You,838.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,948.0,"you know, everything about how neurons compute is about sub threshold very interesting biophysics and integration across the, you know, unique and neuron type specific uh dendritic trees that they used to collect information with. Um,"
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,1007.0,Right.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Carolyn Bayer,1140.0,Right.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Barbara Smith,1006.0,"And so we uh we develop um integrated systems for like pipels uh so for endometrial cancer for instance that um right now they go in blind and um an OBGYN will take out cells um in in throughout the uterus, but it's just a vacuum system that they'll place in and they'll um release a vacuum and then that tube will be removed manually. And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so um how we um re I I would say um reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding area so we can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds. So they're doing acoustic information anyways. Um so we've we've integrated tools into research and clinical."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Sixian You,615.0,"sound the unscattering property, right? So if we know the signal is there, can we use ultrasound to confine the signal there, to modulate the signal, and then to get the signal back. So I think that could be very interesting and I need to learn more about Barbara's research on electrodes as wave guide. Uh, it sounds really fascinating."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Alexandra Dickinson,771.0,"Yeah, and plants, I mean, one way people use plants is is like for phytoremediation. So plants suck up the toxins and then degrade them is the idea and then release, you know, the the graded bits into the atmosphere so it's safe."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,800.0,"What integrative techniques allow wide field screening of tissue to identify a region of interest which can be subsequently imaged at very high magnifications, perhaps super resolution. So in some sense that's been talked about maybe in other sessions, but um."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Carolyn Bayer,1060.0,"Yeah, that's what I was about to say. That's what I always ask when I meet people who do wave front shaping."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Carolyn Bayer,1086.0,Or or half a centimeter. How about half a centimeter?
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Sixian You,1102.0,So wave front image uh engineering.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Barbara Smith,733.0,Someone's occupied ours.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Barbara Smith,740.0,It's probably the people we've occupied.
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,802.0,"So yeah, especially light sheet microscopy."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Brad Smith,898.0,"Uh, can photoacoustic image save the day? I I don't know. maybe shouldn't use that phrase, but it's photoacoustic imaging has promise, I don't know, has has promise and challenges. I don't know um."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Aniruddha Ray,956.0,"Um, or or even a few micron resolution."
2021_05_21_ABI_S15,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,1038.0,"I'm I'm looking at history, but I don't actually see the right version."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Kevin Cash,935.0,"So rather than measuring a wide suite of things, we measure oxygen and say, well, that's a good proxy for what's going on and use that to look at spatial and temporal dynamics."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Lu Wei,600.0,"cell transcriptomics, um, uh, and also the mass spec, uh, measurement on the on the bulk level. Um, on the, uh, specially resolved level, we're trying to identify new signatures from Raman and trying to, um, resolve the metabolic control, um, um, um, for disease systems. So, uh, recently we, uh, we're trying to identify, um, the metabolic system abilities during, uh, the development of drug resistance in, uh, melanoma patients."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Jin Zhang,808.0,"Yeah, that actually sort of uh um is related to uh one of the uh things that mentioned by different people. I think in terms of looking at metabolites uh or metabolic processes uh what I guess what are the targets, the variety of different targets that we're we're thinking about. I I guess uh summarizing different, you know, different people's uh intro, uh, you know, we looked at uh newly synthesized metabolites as a sort of a whole class, uh specific species, um, NADPH, NADH, uh or oxygen uh as a proxy or or uh developing specific probes for a very specific metabolite.

And as Kevin mentioned, uh perhaps, you know, patterns, uh features of any of those, right? as a you know, class uh or as a individual species could be used for diagnostic purpose. Just to uh throw the question out there."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Ping Wang,1091.0,"Uh so um in terms of diabetes um there's a there's a very big problem for us like for the endogenous beta cell imaging, beta cell mass imaging. That's a very big problem and people trying to solve this problem for 20 years still not successful. Um because of limited uh special resolution and also the sensitivity we use. We have been tried with the MRI mostly and some people tried pet. So that's why people trying to uh combine the pet MRI uh to complement each other to increase the uh sensitivity and the special resolution. Um in creating um like receptor imaging also it's a big big part for the metabolic imaging. Um example for that is the GLP1 glucagon like peptide one. Um that's also related to the beta cell imaging."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Ping Wang,708.0,"Yeah, some uh developed for the optical imaging can um also can be considered like radio labeled, yeah, for para paramize."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Candace Fleischer,961.0,"it's it's naturally integrated into every MRI whether you use it or not. You you kind of have to pay extra for it when you're buying your system. So if you didn't do that you won't have it. But um even non-academic sites are using spectroscopy for tumors. Um so I wouldn't say it's routine, but I would say for so for example for fatty liver disease it is routine because that's a really great way to quickly sample fat distribution."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Lu Wei,1095.0,And also um uh I I saw there's a question on um whether there's a aptamer uh based uh probes that could be developed to imaging metabolites.
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Jin Zhang,639.0,"Well, I guess related to that, there perhaps um, there isn't a need to really look at very, very specific species, right, in that setting. Just uh looking at overall perhaps, you know, phospho phosphorus um or or fat signal, um you don't have to really look at a one particular lipid species. That's my question related to the MRI."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Candace Fleischer,693.0,"Um so we can take an image and see areas that were weren't resected given metabolic ratios in the brain and then we can target those regions. Um, so you you're right, you certainly don't have to. It can be untarget kind of an untarget metabolomics approach."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Seu Sim,961.0,Yeah.
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Alexandra Walsh,811.0,"Right. So it's it's just like normal fluorescence. So whatever techniques you use, it's it we can do it too. Um, so so we can do single photon and it's really great at looking at cells on a dish, but we can also adapt it for multiphoton and optical technologies that can do three-dimensional things like organoids or even in vivo up to a couple millimeters."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Kevin Cash,890.0,"Uh yeah, I can share the screen."
2021_05_21_ABI_S14,Allison Dennis,639.0,"think given the constraints of the the report out, keeping it to the general challenges, like there's always the challenge of signal to noise and the um, having enough signal for a small concentration analyte. Those things are endemic regardless of your modality."
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Benjamin Bartelle,749.0,"Sorry, Arizona State University."
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Matt Lovett-Barron,919.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Matt Lovett-Barron,839.0,Yeah.
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Alexandra Dickinson,1002.0,"Um you can that's a good question. I would have to think about that. That does not really exist, but there are there is a movement towards towards doing liquid mass spectro or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Sorry."
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Benjamin Bartelle,636.0,"Okay, how about that? Yeah. How about something like that? How do we use large data sets? Nobody says big data, right? That's that's gosh now, right?"
2021_05_20_ABI_S6,Anna Moore,661.0,"Okay, wait. Okay, 25."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Alexandra Dickinson,624.0,"41, yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,648.0,"Uh, I can do reporter if no one if no one else wants to do it."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,799.0,and
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,809.0,"Sure. Yeah, so the general field of completion microscopy, contrast can be anything. Um so for me specifically, I've my my current history has focused mostly on uh fluorescence and phase imaging and refractive index imaging. So right now specifically I'm focusing more on refractive index as a label free technique. So this is maybe that's why I've been placing this scenario."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Stefan Wilhelm,1116.0,"I'm just curious, so for the uh for the applications you want to do, um what is the motivation of go to higher I mean super resolution if the if you are just looking for nanoparticles. You only see where nanoparticles are uh in terms of relationship with the intracellular structures, fine structures or"
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Stefan Wilhelm,610.0,"show and our our hope is once we understand what those transport mechanisms and pathways are, we can design uh drug carriers that are more efficient in overcoming uh the blood vessel walls. So hopefully this will eventually lead to increasing the delivery of drugs into solid tumors. Thanks."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Wei Min,610.0,"probes that requires chemical engineering and organic synthesis. Sure, sure. It's something that Raman's Raman's typically don't work out, right? So again, it's it's an interface type of thing. Yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,771.0,"Oh, they have a 3D library. a 3D collection. Like like they that includes a 3D phase library? Like 3D refractive index library?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,858.0,"Wait, so does that mean that they're going to like fly over to the Allen Institute to do their data collection or they'll build a copy of that microscope and."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,David Van Valen,983.0,"Exactly, right?"
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Wei Min,921.0,"For example, auto fluorescence, right? It it's also a non label free uh sorry, a non label strategy. So for us can work with those. It's just that fluorescence has sufficiently high sensitivity that you just need one type of protein can give you sufficient signal."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,1061.0,"Like ramen, photo acoustics. A lot of these very complex even like a lot of light sheet microscopes are like when you see them in in an optic lab they look extremely intimidating."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Shwetadwip Chowdhury,1107.0,"Yeah, so yeah."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Luke Mortensen,980.0,"Like maybe you could use that to get the same kind of refractive index information, you know, to some degree and that if it could be combined with like whatever like Raman, you know, maybe there may be ways to get all the way back where you can use the pluses and minuses of each technology. Um, because I mean even things like uh reflectance confocal microscopy which have been around for like ages, you know, are um provide a ton of information and people are still struggling with how to make that meaningful for for others to use, you know, like people are trying to I don't know, create like H and E variants so you can look at the skin and have like a live H and E stain really look around, you know, like a and other people like that. Um, so it seems like there's just like this spectrum of opportunity."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Wei Min,760.0,You you buy like 15 nanometer bead and then you calibrate your your resolution of a microscope. That's something that people always been always do that.
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Wei Min,839.0,"I think Rama is is definitely quantitative by nature. It's it's in my mind is even more quantitative than fluorescence because uh it the signal is always linearly depend on the concentration of chemical bond in your in your probe volume and there's no energy transfer, no photo bleaching, no self quenching. So essentially we're reporting the number of chemical bonds in the sample. So that's what we can report. And of course, how to translate that into a concentration or into, you know, how much what's the milligram of the molecules that that needs some simple chemical conversion, but I think the the whole the whole chain of the calculation is very very very very quantitative."
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Srigokul Upadhyayula,750.0,"Yeah, so we've actually published um in 2019 the combination of expansion with lattice light sheet. Um the application obviously there is that we can do scalable tissue level um super imaging, right? Um"
2021_05_21_ABI_S3,Barbara Smith,834.0,Now well expansion is not
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Laura Barge,617.0,"Looks like it, yeah."
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Niki Parenteau,629.0,So more of an agnostic bio signature?
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Victoria S Meadows,835.0,"But but I mean but the time scales of that those impacts are going to be fairly long. So I mean we, you know, we as a species, you know, we can't really propose that we're going to observe for millions of years to see something happen. So is is there any is there any other mechanism you can think of that might produce an observable like it are there are there are there things that would move in concert in a certain way because of regulation that that we"
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Nathaniel Gabor,884.0,"And so there's a pattern there that suggests that you know, you're getting you're taking a snapshot in time of the process of these mushrooms growing in a sense. So there might be regulation in that sense that you could take a snapshot of, you know, say trees on a on a continent and it might tell you something about whether they've regulated."
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Nathaniel Gabor,740.0,"Can I follow on that? I so so we had this I had a little discussion yesterday that it was just like what Nicole suggested I think where um if you step back from the context of of exoplanet science for a second, right now there's a lot of effort in putting people in space again, right? Getting them to the moon and potentially getting them to Mars. And it really makes me wonder if you could piggy back on these missions to basically build instruments that were had a much quicker turnaround, were not nearly as capable as these big missions, but when combined, you could perhaps do something like interferometrically that would allow you to observe in a very different way. So I I actually as an outsider, I was wondering, you know, given the current emphasis in getting people on the moon again, you could imagine instrumentation on the moon that is basically doing some sort of combined effort astronomy where it's not so focused and siloed. Um, I don't know if that's feasible from, you know, the perspective of your funding and how that would ever happen, but it seems like an opportunity, right? There's this kind of effort for commercialization of space travel. So maybe you could take advantage of that in the short term."
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Niki Parenteau,930.0,"So I mean if you look at Mars as an example, look at how many missions we've had there. And so they were, I mean discounting Viking, at first they were habitability missions and now we're moving into life detection. And so if you think about that translate that to exoplanets, what would be your ideal situation to have a series of missions and maybe you initially come up with some, um, I think Tessa Fisher coined this phrase bio hints and how might you follow that up."
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Victoria S Meadows,840.0,Rocky things have atmospheres too. Just tiny ones.
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Victoria S Meadows,836.0,"I I think at this point too, Nikki, we might just have to go to what are our three bullet points and try and figure those out in the next 15 minutes, maybe start to synthesize instead of going off in a new direction. new topic if we're not sure we can do justice to what you've just put out there. Um Yeah, I think yeah, my my concept of this topic was much more in the confidence level direction, but I think we've really gone into alternative bio signatures instead and I say we just go with it and um yeah, write out what we have here."
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Victoria S Meadows,852.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S1,Victoria S Meadows,923.0,And the link to the PowerPoint's in the chat. I can put it in.
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Anat Shahar,922.0,"So the way it's been working in the previous ones that I've been in at least is that, you know, you basically write down everything that people are saying is to the best of your ability and then at the end we kind of look through it and and come up with key points and summarize uh themes."
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Laura Schaefer,694.0,"There is actually a crust. it's got very it's got extreme heat output but it's very localized in in specific volcanic centers. Um and you know, it looks like there is a lot of global resurfacing going on, but that largely seems to be plume deposits and not necessarily volcanic, you know, lava flows crossing the surface. A lot of volcanism on IO is is restricted to lava lakes uh actually, which are, you know, pumping out a lot of heat. Um so the the internal heat mechanism uh heat uh transport mechanism on IO is heat pipe um transported. there's no stagnant lid or or plate tectonics kind of tectonic settling. Um so you've got these very localized centers but the rest of this the surface seems stable."
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Jennifer Glass,970.0,Lower. Like one is like pure water and then it goes down.
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Jennifer Glass,970.0,Lower. Like one is like pure water and then it goes down.
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Jennifer Glass,820.0,"But I think that life can survive in clouds, just not Venus's. I think it does in our clouds."
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Daniel Apai,914.0,"I think a similar example is that there's very large number of brown dwarfs out there. Many of them have temperatures. We know now some that have temperatures that are as cold as Earth or sometimes even cooler than that. And so they have regions within their atmospheres, of course there's temperature gradients etc. But they are they are regions in the atmospheres where water can condense out and uh there are some obvious challenges, but uh I think those objects may actually be easier to access than habitable planets and study."
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Jennifer Glass,1057.0,The way is completely unknown and and I think most biologists don't think it's from life. So.
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Nicolas Cowan,841.0,"And then the other thing we talked about was um the we talked for a while about the naked cores of like sub Neptunes and whether those are really any different or less habitable than um than uh like a bonafide rocky planet and the consensus seemed to be they're probably not that different. They might actually have more volatiles if I understood correctly because they've lost, you know, they started with a whole bunch of volatiles and then they just lost the hydrogen and the helium and so they might end up with like more carbon and nitrogen and oxygen than we would expect on a terrestrial planet. But I maybe I got that backwards. So Laura, if I got it backwards, correct me, please."
2021_06_11_SLU_S10,Nikole Lewis,648.0,"there would be like a sky based algae bloom, is that what you're okay."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Nicolas Cowan,665.0,"Yeah, Chris beat me to it."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Victoria S Meadows,771.0,"Yeah, I I might recommend to Silog that they create create the documents for us because I've seen that and I just it's break out group one, two, three."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Jennifer Glass,963.0,Yeah.
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Andro Rios,1083.0,"They see these other organics that maybe they don't necessarily link to biotic chemistry, but perhaps um, you know, perhaps this is a way to identify false positives or maybe emerging biological."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Jennifer Glass,648.0,Just pointing out that there's two hands raised too.
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Edwin Kite,786.0,"Uh yeah, so Stephanie and I have talked about one possibility. So uh, with mass and radius data alone, uh, we can't tell the difference between a world with a really deep ocean uh, and a world with no ocean at all. Um, so uh, an example would be uh a world with a uh buried clathrate layer that uh around a main sequence star that as the uh star warms up, the clathrate is destabilized gradually and so you have a a leak of methane into the atmosphere and that would could be totally consistent with an oxygenated atmosphere that forms early through hydrogen escape."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Tyler Robinson,910.0,"biological fluxes of things, what are plausible abiotic fluxes of things, um is a is a great way of um trying to get around um the the back and forth debate of what can make go to, what can't make go to, what can make methane, what can't make methane."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Jennifer Glass,979.0,"Very much less probable. And so if we see something that looked like we thought it was a bio signature there, we might want to be extra cautious given those circumstances."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Tyler Robinson,655.0,Low key as in the trickster God.
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Victoria S Meadows,672.0,Like a Loki planets?
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Jennifer Glass,692.0,"Okay, false positive."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Nicolas Cowan,865.0,"I have a question about the icy moons. How long do we have to wait for them to be habitable in the exoplanet sense that that the ice will melt? Like as the sun gets brighter eventually the icy moons are going to have surface liquid water. How long is that going to last for? And like is it is it conceivable if you look at evolved stars that you could be seeing a planet that is now a water world that used to be an icy world or something? I mean we find planets around evolved stars. It'd be it'd be a funny day, right? For the dolphins that have a whole civilization under the ice and then one day the ice melts and they're like, woo! The whole world out there."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Edwin Kite,998.0,Um it's like two paragraphs in a nature paper no one's followed up on it. Um and um it's not clear that it's a correct argument. Uh maybe the ocean is just silica saturated somehow and the nanosilica is um just condensing right below the water uh table in the vents.
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Edward Schwieterman,696.0,"But that's you might be fooled if you don't have complete observations, right Vicky? I mean, um, like um your yours and uh and Jake's paper that showed that uh Archean Earth and uh modern Earth, you'd see the methane and the CO2 really well, but not the oxygen. And so the oxidation state would be really hard to get."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Edward Schwieterman,1181.0,"Uh yes and and and you may actually drive hydrogen escape. So I think, you know, if you photolyze the methane and and escape the hydrogen and then you you also have an oxidizing flux to, you know, so I think I think you definitely need to consider that and that has to do with the, you know, the kinetics versus the thermodynamics and the and and and thinking about the evolution, the time scale uh of the system and I I add kind of the flux."
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Victoria S Meadows,743.0,abiotic. doesn't produce by life.
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Tyler Robinson,760.0,It seems like future exoplanet scientists um and maybe someone on this call um is going to have some constraint on the methane flux into some terrestrial exoplanet atmosphere that they obtain via retrieval and they're going to know how does this compare to abiotic and biological sources. Um and you're going to want to plop it down on a plot like we were just
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Christopher Reinhard,696.0,"Yeah, yeah, I guess the way that I would I I guess would frame that is that you know, the the methane false positives and negatives is kind of a one particular example of this broader sort of trickster problem because it's that's an idea that could be you know, presumably applied to any uh putative bio signature. Um so"
2021_06_10_SLU_S4,Katherine de Kleer,883.0,"And broadly speaking, the exchange of materials between interiors and surfaces is relevant to to all types of planets and moons."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Dimitar Sasselov,689.0,"Oh, great. Thank you, Kimberly. So Kimberly is going to be our recorder and reporter."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Dimitar Sasselov,734.0,I think they like to use their Google Docs so that they can combine them in some way.
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Laura Barge,831.0,"Hello everybody. So my name is Laurie Barge. I'm a research scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and I'm a lab scientist mostly, though I do do some field work as well and my group is the Origins and Habitability Lab, so we study the origin of life and how life can live elsewhere. So I do a lot of work on mineral synthesis, organic chemistry with minerals, phosphorus and nitrogen chemistry."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Laura Barge,939.0,"There people talk about this for Enceladus because they found those organics in the plume and, you know, there's I know a debate in astronomy, which I'm not as familiar with, so maybe some of you know, but is Enceladus 4 billion years old like the rest of the stuff or is it young and formed with Saturn's rings? And if if you could imagine it were younger then is it a prebiotic world now? And so that's really interesting to me and the organics in the plume are all things that we've made in the lab prebiotically, but they're also things that life makes. So"
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Dimitar Sasselov,966.0,That's a good point actually.
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Laura Barge,1104.0,"If someone then could model what that would be over millions of years and then give input to the next reaction, that would be super helpful because right now we look at someone else's experiment and we're like, well, you made methane. We will have methane. And then we will make the next thing. But like I would it would be great if there was modeling in between to kind of help us do the next experiment."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Liming Li,1114.0,"That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course, the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know, for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one way to better measure to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. I I mean it will help help us to find life maybe help us to find liquid water and life and so on. So that's my my idea, you know, I'm trying something for the planets in our solar system, not for exoplanets, but I think maybe it's worth of trying for the exoplanets."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Laura Barge,978.0,"Well the the earliest life evidence that's just kind of an upper bound because, you know, we don't it's it's a rock problem really. We don't have any evidence. But also origin of life, it's not it's fast but also not fast because it's geologically rapid. But also like certain parts that people study like these messy chemistries making organic monomers and whatnot, that could go on and on and just never get anywhere, but then there's bottleneck reactions where, you know, you need something specific to happen or it can't move forward."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Aaron Engelhart,1072.0,"10 minutes, okay."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Laura Barge,661.0,"I guess you would need an overarching model, right? Because you would have long-term geological process and then you'd have short-term lab process that could be extrapolated to long-term, which would then give you the input for another short-term lab process."
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Dimitar Sasselov,677.0,Yeah.
2021_06_10_SLU_S5,Ziming Yang,884.0,"Yeah. Yeah, radicals already they they are very quick reactions, right? So uh it has some like uh like you know, a very very short short scale and for the modeling I think maybe uh uh you know, you guys learned about that is is not easy to do that. But well I think we can definitely try, you know, if it's worth is very important and very interesting. Um, and we we can design some model system to study that. you know, we we have done some like uh model organic compound that we know exactly what kinds of radicals can be formed and then we can use some you know different uh parameters, right? And to examine how the radicals, you know, form, maybe some chain reactions over time and uh yeah, so make things a little bit simpler at the beginning. So"
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Andro Rios,741.0,"Yeah, you know, that's that's a good point. Yeah, and I was thinking more of instead of these dead end products that are being formed, which are typically really just, you know, the bad stuff. You want things to to feed back to itself so you can actually have a system go. Um, and so yeah, related to that and optimal, maybe not positive. Yeah, thank you for that."
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Stilianos Louca,1092.0,So could autocatalysis be considered almost an almost certain signature of of of life of of a biotically driven um reaction network? That would be my my intuition.
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Dimitar Sasselov,1152.0,That's hard stuff.
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Gregory Fournier,977.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Gregory Fournier,1093.0,"Oh yeah, and there's direct phylogenomic evidence of that. Um, you can look at uh green non sulfur bacteria and the most deeply branch it the most deeply branching groups are photoheterotrophs."
2021_06_11_SLU_S11,Laura Barge,901.0,"And so like with a mission, you have to detect a bunch of different things in order to make an attempt at a biosignature identification. So it's things like, you know, do we have organic molecules? What kind are they? Carbon isotopes. People look at things like cell motility or imaging. There's atmospheric detection of things that we think are just made by life and it just kind of depends on what your spacecraft constraints are and there's all sorts of technical problems here. But basically it is in some ways similar because if you detect let's say a carbon molecule or molecules or a distribution or a functionality like an autocatalytic reaction or something like that together is it life? Because you know that each one of those can happen abiotically, otherwise you could not have life's origin."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Dimitar Sasselov,805.0,So there we go. Why don't we start with the chemistry then?
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Aaron Engelhart,896.0,"Um the third and there's five here just you know where I am on this. And um is uh you know, thinking about prebiotic chemistry. I think we think of it as something that happened and then there was life. But I think that it's worth considering it as we think of these questions as kind of a progress bar for the emergence of life, you know, we go from low complexity to kind of what Dimitar is talking about higher complexity. Um and I think that that might kind of inform some of our thinking about, you know, we're talking about with exoplanets. Uh and then finally the last two are kind of related. Um there's going to obviously be some geochemical constraints on what kind of protobiomolecules emerge and that's going to vary from body to body. Um and this is going to have uh you know, impacts from a chemical perspective in terms of, you know, what surfaces are presented and what kind of chemistry you can do on the surfaces."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Dimitar Sasselov,945.0,"Aaron, this is great and thank you for starting us off. Um there is a lot to unpack there. So uh maybe we can take it one step at a time."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Laura Barge,912.0,"But even if you look at the whole origin of life, which is a blip geologically, then even then you're zooming in super spin. And so any experiment that anyone's doing is going to be like this much and then you have to come back out and then you have to come back in to do the next experiment because it's not it's not just not possible for one person or lab to do the whole origin of life because you have to the time scale just doesn't make sense. Like how many chemical reactions can happen in months or a thesis time or something like that. So this is why we all work on different reactions, but they all have to connect conceptually."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Peter Driscoll,1132.0,Um and then there could be a completely dead geologically dead planet. And so I think there's really a whole range of those and of course a planet can pass through those regimes in time.
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Aaron Engelhart,714.0,"Yeah, I think so."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Laura Barge,892.0,"You then find out that there's a different rate when you have 0.5 molar of sodium chloride and on and on it goes. And it's like this for silica, phosphorus, nitrogen. And so you end up having to do just an infinite amount of experiments to really understand what's going on and I don't know if the models are able to predict these things or if maybe just more modeling needs to be done before we do the experiment."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Aaron Engelhart,947.0,"silicates and it does it reversibly and we're kind of excited about it because it seems like that could be kind of a way to do compartmentalization because these lipid assemblies don't really work very well at high salt. But from what I can find, we don't completely understand what's happening when you have these uh perchlorate or the class of salts that it calls uh that uh they're member of is called a catro catrope driven uh association of nucleic acids with silicates."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Kimberly Lau,712.0,Shorter.
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Liming Li,954.0,"For example, for earth is is special for earth the the difference temperature difference between surface and the top of atmosphere just a couple of 10 degrees, 20 maybe 30 degrees, not very huge. But if you check uh Venus, if you check Titan, the temperature difference is huge. So that's mean even you're current I mean actually I'm not the expert of exoplanet. I I'm not sure which method they are using to determine the temperature of exoplanets. But by my point even for the planets in our solar system, even for the planets and moons in our solar system, we don't have determine very well the surface temperature. You know, because so uh of course we have some in situ measurements for the mass surface temperature, but if you check the global, I mean global scale temperature, that's other problem. So that's mean what's the radiation budget on the top, what's the radiation transfer inside of atmosphere, then what's the precisely what's the temperature on the surface. I I mean and global scale. That's actually even for Mars, we don't have very good very good knowledge for that. Of course the for the same thing for the Venus, for the Titan, you know for maybe for yeah. So I mean if we if we can figure out one one way to better determine the surface temperature of exoplanets. That I mean it will help help us to find life help us to find liquid water and life and so on. So that's my my idea, you know I'm trying something for the planets in our solar system, not for exoplanets, but I think maybe it's worth of trying for exoplanets."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Aaron Engelhart,1112.0,I agree.
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Laura Barge,834.0,"Well, the the earliest life evidence that's just kind of an upper bound because, you know, we don't it's it's a rock problem really. We don't have any evidence. But also origin of life, it's not it's fast but also not fast because it's geologically rapid."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Aaron Engelhart,968.0,"Basically, if you take a uh typical membrane component and cut it in half and you have a fatty acid, that's pretty much what uh we have as the model for early membranes. And those can't hold a proton gradient."
2021_06_10_SLU_S2,Ziming Yang,741.0,"Yeah, so yeah, radicals already they they are very quick reactions, right? So uh, you have some like, you know, uh, like you know, a very very short short scale and for the modeling I think maybe uh, uh, you know, you guys learned about that is is not easy to do that.

2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Anat Shahar,643.0,"Okay, we have one exempt."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Shawn Domagal,667.0,"Thank you, Greg."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Gregory Fournier,827.0,"Yeah, I think we have to be sorry. Um, I think it's important to make a distinction between an origin of life versus a uh origin of a detectable biosphere or a persistence of life. Because if you have some instance of abiogenesis where, you know, locally chemical evolution acquires Darwinian characteristics and however you want to define that process, you have something like life."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Shawn Domagal,921.0,I just it's hardest when you're the speaker as well. I'm just acknowledging.
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Christopher Reinhard,989.0,"Yeah, then and to to that point Edwin that the Stephanie Stephanie Olsen who's been doing some interesting three dimensional ocean modeling um just varying salinity and seeing what it does to climate state and the impact is just totally astonishing. Um so you know you vary salinity uh within you know what is kind of maybe even a pedestrian range for history and on its own that can be the difference between, you know, a temperate climate and a snowball planet."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Anat Shahar,1153.0,Please go ahead. Absolutely.
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Anat Shahar,793.0,"We should put that on the website, Chris. Holy Grail model."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Betül Kaçar,880.0,I think this is also important for folks um who who study geochemistry and not necessarily study life.
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Shawn Domagal,965.0,"And and the outer solar system means that Catherine's an expert on is an example of such. I thought was really interesting. Because as an earth scientist, I think of the I think of I think of waterborne but uninhabited planets is the most difficult to model, but I I hadn't thought about Catherine's take on that point."
2021_06_11_SLU_S7,Anat Shahar,990.0,"Yeah, thank you Greg and thank you everyone for all that really great conversation."
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Coco Zhang,829.0,"Yeah, so it's like a there is a range of the total amount of water. It's like the depth of your ocean, how deep, how shallow it can be and how what is the deepest limit."
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Smadar Naoz,811.0,"and a specific inclination. But if you think about the ort cloud of or if you think about um our our own Quiper belt that has some thickness to it, um the Opic method starts to fail. So then all the predictions are not so good. So this is something that I've been thinking about a lot recently and I think that um trying from analytical point of view to try to really understand how this behavior will like exactly what you asked, where will I put the Jupiter in order to know how many impacts I'll get from different positions. I I think this requires something that well I'm plugging it in. But so something that we're working on now really to try to uh to find a a new way um it's it's pretty straightforward actually, but any way to try to uh to generalize the Opic method to different um to different configurations and to generalize to general rocks that they can come from wherever and not necessarily from uh you know, the same plane that Jupiter lies. So it's really exciting for me from this point of view apart from all the other point of views that you guys have talked about."
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Daniel Huber,958.0,"Yeah. Yeah, not not close enough to mess with the orbits, yeah."
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Andrew Vanderburg,1075.0,A few of us were thinking about that yesterday. And I think what we concluded is that the biggest difference will be that older stars will have fewer radiogenic elements so you won't get less radioactive decay and heating in the core.
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Smadar Naoz,678.0,Mhm.
2021_06_11_SLU_S6,Daniel Apai,705.0,"I mean of course you would expect the metallicity to to have probably the largest impact on the gas giants occurrence rates. But yeah, I I I agree with you. I mean I think that's quite possible that you would end up with."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Andrew Vanderburg,600.0,"Hi everyone. Um, I'm Andrew Vanderberg. I am an astronomer at the University of Wisconsin Madison, but I'm moving to MIT this summer. Um, I study exoplanets mostly with observations using space telescopes and instruments on the ground."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Natasha Batalha,724.0,"Hi all. Uh Natasha Batalia, I'm a researcher at NASA Ames. I've been there mostly in the in the post pandemic world, so only been there for about a year. But um, I also do theoretical characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and some observations."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Keith Hawkins,775.0,"Hi everyone. Um, I'm Keith Hawkins. Um, I'm an assistant professor at UT Austin in my I guess going into my fourth year, which is kind of crazy. Um, I actually have to I'll drop off the call in about 20 minutes and come back because I have my third year mid 10 year review. Um, and what was I going to say? Oh yes, I do I'm probably the only person here that doesn't really focus that much on exoplanets. I do galactic archaeology and galactic science. Um, with an emphasis on stellar um stellar chemistry."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Natasha Batalha,696.0,"And so um, I feel like to to develop a statistical framework requires actually like defining a very focused question in the beginning. And so the questions that I wrote down were just like very basic like what is the fraction of planets that have oxidized versus reduced atmospheres or um, you know, what is the fraction of planets that have compositions that that deviate from chemical equilibrium. Um, I don't know if those like types of those types of questions would get more at the what is the diversity of atmospheres instead of saying like is there oxygen or not."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Daniel Apai,913.0,"Thank you and we can go to those who haven't um shared their thoughts with us yet. So I think Andrew, Nicole, Andy. I go I go ahead. Go ahead Andy. Yeah, I think um when we're thinking about this theoretically, we would all like a nice laboratory where we could, you know, do what Courtney said and change metallicity and look at 30 planets there and then change some other planet some other property and look at planets there. And I think um at least initially we're not going to be so lucky. Um, we're going to have a very, very small number of planets. They're going to have 12 different properties each, their stars are going to have different properties. Um, and that's that's realistically how we're going to start and we're going to learn a lot then and probably refine the experiment as we go as astronomers do unlike normal laboratory scientists."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Nikole Lewis,1046.0,"Okay. Just just the reality of it. Um, but I I don't want to lose sight of pushing for the fact that having a sample of 500 planets is necessary to answer some of the questions that's lingering in all of our minds and thinking about what is necessary to then have that sample size because if we just keep going along of we get what we get and we don't get upset. Um, we're going to make really slow progress. And so that's I think we two pronged approach sort of thing is kind of what I'm thinking about, which is yeah, we're going to learn a lot from those first five habitable zone planets, but"
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Leslie Rogers,922.0,"Yeah, I guess I mean the Havoc report was somewhat centered around these kind of hypothesis testing, like exploring our systems inside the zone different than those outside and kind of granted with a much smaller number of planets than Luvoir, kind of the the strength of a non detection or like a null result is less powerful."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Leslie Rogers,1013.0,"Yeah, I guess I mean the Havoc report was somewhat centered around these kind of hypothesis testing, like exploring our systems inside the zone different than those outside and kind of granted with a much smaller number of planets than Luvoir, kind of the the strength of a non detection or like a null result is less powerful. So I think there are there are perhaps some questions that are completely inaccessible to the smaller Havoc scale meeting like mission, like um time variability on a given planet perhaps. But the other questions that you could address with either, it would be kind of the level of scope. Like and and it would be somewhat what you would like if 50 if 50% of planets in the habitable zone have a detectable bio signature, then Havoc would detect one, but if that's optimistically not the case, then um you'd have a null result and just set some kind of upper limit. And and the upper limit that you'd get from a null result with Havoc is just a lot less informative than with Luvoir. It's still informative given our current prior state of knowledge, but um yeah, I I would kind of divide the questions into two different categories. There's some that you could just still do with Havoc, but definitely do way better with Luvoir and then there are others that like just are inaccessible."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Andy Skemer,1115.0,Sorry.
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Lisa Kaltenegger,668.0,"I think just like a very short comment on that, like talking to the biologists that do evolution, they don't really care about the moon. They uh, I think this is sometimes a notion that we have because we have one, but they are saying if life actually evolved on a planet without a moon where the the climate is maybe not as stable or seasonal, shouldn't matter, especially not if it's in the ocean or subsurface or if it evolved for it. So so it's not I I completely had the same idea that you had before that uh that a moon was essential, but every biologist I've spoken so far actually uh does not agree with that notion. So I think it's something that um is very interesting to see, you know, how often do these crashes happen and I think uh an even more interesting thing is like are these crashes a requirement or very useful for plate tectonics? I think this is where it becomes actually very interesting because that is different, right? So the moon is now stabilizing or doing the rotation thing or stabilizing the seasons, but maybe it's helping get plate tectonics started. That's uh kind of line of thought that a couple of people were thinking about making a moon potentially important. Sorry, but um is there anything that that you guys want to want to discuss of those ideas or do we just have a potpourri of ideas and then whenever you have like the the get together with all the the fellows only, uh you're going to flesh out something more? I don't know."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Andrew Vanderburg,1157.0,"Yeah, we'll have stellar types easily."
2021_06_10_SLU_S3,Eliza Kempton,726.0,The D to H ratio requires a completely different uh observational setup than most of what we've been talking about so far today. That's I mean that that's that's probably that's very high spectral resolution probably ground based instruments uh we haven't we haven't we haven't talked about we haven't talked much about observations from the ground today.
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Richard Wiener,681.0,"Maybe in the meantime, uh you guys can take a moment, look at the prompt and write a few thoughts down and then hopefully Lisa will be joining us shortly and we'll see how it goes from there. Um I'll be back in a couple minutes if we don't get Lisa. Okay. And of course yeah, if you guys are done after a minute writing down, uh you can certainly uh introduce one another to if if you anyone hasn't met anyone else and uh yeah, we'll see what happens. I anticipate Lisa will be here in a minute. Oh, here she is."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Meredith MacGregor,827.0,"This is the first time I'm in a group with like not a lot of biologists and a lot of astronomers. So um I do observational astronomy. I pretty much use any telescope I can get time on, which ranges from the radio through the optical, through the UV and the X-ray and I am really interested in trying to observe and understand all parts of planetary systems."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Keith Hawkins,976.0,"Um using stars as fossils, but I you know, work very heavily on stellar chemistry. So I'm trained as an observational spectroscopist and do a lot of stuff with combining stellar chemistry, dynamics, ages and so forth to understand Milky Way formation. But in the context of um habitability and exoplanets, um I'm I also have a strong interest in um trying to understand the star planet connection."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Katherine de Kleer,1050.0,"You know, like Meredith, every telescope I can get my hands on optical, infrared, millimeter and radio um or ground based, space based, whatever. Um and I am particularly interested in the the the atmospheres, surfaces and geological activity of moons and um asteroids in the solar system and relevant to this the topic of this session."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Lisa Kaltenegger,676.0,Noah?
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Lisa Kaltenegger,738.0,"3.2, right? Yes, great."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Bradford Foley,785.0,"I can go next. Um,"
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Keith Hawkins,875.0,"Um, metal content is a is an is a large factor in whether you have the raw materials um to have a rocky planets and be life in general. Um, and so metallicity is going to confine which stellar population, thin disc to halo bulge um that you can find yourself in. So metallicity and elemental abundance in general, metallicity are a general proxy um for you know, where in the galaxy life could exist."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Katherine de Kleer,995.0,this
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Keith Hawkins,720.0,"So if you look at the inner galaxy versus the outer galaxy, do you see anything um that happens to discs? That might be really difficult to do because I'm I'm guessing that these are all very local, my guess. Um, but but I think it would be I would start looking at spatial position and kinematics rather than trying to go down the middle."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Andrew Vanderburg,845.0,"Because I think some of us may be talking about the metallicity of the star and some of us may be talking about the metallicity of the planet. Yeah, got you."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Katherine de Kleer,751.0,"You either you either need really extreme so in the case of IO, the the vent ejection velocities are not um high enough that you I mean, you're not actually getting escape velocity straight out of the vent. What happens is uh because the magnetic field is so strong and you have this plasma, um the material in the upper atmosphere becomes ionized and then it's lost because now it's just going with the the rotational velocity of the magnetic field. And so if you had one of your M dwarfs that was really magnetically active and you had your planets close enough that they were experiencing a significant magnetic field, then you could have this process without even needing too crazy of volcanism because it's just stripping off the upper atmosphere."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Katherine de Kleer,897.0,"The volcanism, in this case the volcanism is what replenishes the atmosphere because otherwise it would be gone in no time because of the magnetic field."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Lisa Kaltenegger,986.0,"I think one of the things that would also be really interesting is what kind of systems would you want? So you know, what external factors would you want like a small planet with high activity, right? So that you lose the material really easily for another planet that's like next to it. I don't know, can you uh, Katherine, can you think about would this be scalable at all? Like if you if you increase the masses, is there any reason why it should not scale? Is it gravity, you know, when the gravity gets too high, is it maybe you cannot lose it even when it's magnetized and ionized anymore or"
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Bradford Foley,613.0,"Um, I mean I would expect most rocky planets to have volcanism at least at some point in their lifetime, um, unless they're just born with like hardly any heat producing elements and are in, you know, some orbit configuration where they get like no tidal heating. Um, there's some ideas about um as there's like a couple papers saying that really massive super earth planets if they have stagnant lids might not have volcanism at all because any melt you'd form would form at such high pressure because it's beneath this thick stagnant lid and it's a high gravity planet so the pressure gradient's really high so and the forming really high pressure there's a pressure crossover where melt is actually denser than solid and it wouldn't rise up and erupt anymore. But I also think that result's kind of like really heavily model and parameter dependent and so I wouldn't necessarily take that as like a really general, you know, big super earth planets are always going to have trouble outgassing. So yeah, I mean I would generally expect like most I would expect your typical rocky planet to have volcanism at least at some point in its history. Um, it might die out really on if it doesn't have a lot of heat producing elements and if it has a stagnant lid, but it's probably going to be at least some volcanism. And if you got a lot of tidal heating in some packed system then that's probably going to be volcanically active for a very long time."
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Lisa Kaltenegger,891.0,uh
2021_06_11_SLU_S9,Keith Hawkins,795.0,"Oh yeah, you could do it for tons of stuff in G stars. Just close. Just not M. M yeah, M is M is a challenge."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Tori Hoehler,1088.0,"Yeah, go ahead."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Andro Rios,688.0,"That sounds really interesting and particularly from an, you know, I mean the organic if we're talking about organic molecules, I mean then they need to bring in an organic chemist or people that are interested in structures and and figuring out, you know, what I was actually going to talk about about, you know, uh a continuity of precursor molecules which you see that same isotopic signature in the same kind of precursor compound related to a a daughter compound in a in a pathway that's more representative of a of a biological system versus just general abiotic chemistry."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Andro Rios,780.0,"Maybe it's something that's that's that's something that is possible. But yeah, the the history of the aqueous alteration and map it out according to uh the isotopic enrichment, that sounds like something that's quite feasible. It looks like you froze, I don't know or maybe I froze."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,658.0,"if there was an input, we could simulate it and see uh what the what the expected observable signature is, what the magnitude is and and exactly how far off from it's not uh not going to be detectable today."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,668.0,"It's not uh not going to be detectable today, but how far off are we from it? Is is there a measurement that one could make with a 30 meter class telescope or is this going to require uh you know, 100 meter telescope, something something, you know, far off in the future. It would be interesting to look into. We just I basically need the predictions on our end."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,751.0,"Yeah, so yeah, so we I mean that that but the but the this technique should be good for um should be quite good for abundance ratios. Uh so it sounds like you're already familiar with this problem. It's good."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Morgan Raven,864.0,"Well, I feel like this is probably relatively far off, but this is my sulfur bias coming through basically is I'm thinking about how might you actually get multiple sulfur bearing phases lofted up into the atmosphere that would be at high enough detection to ever see and some of them might be like cloud condensation nuclei or something like that. Um, sulfate aerosols, things like that."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Natasha Batalha,933.0,"Um, in reflected light, sulfur is kind of a cool haze because it absorbs blue light and so you'd get like an inverted um reflected light slope. So thinking about like future observations of uh directly image planets in reflected light, sulfur haze sulfur products would be an interesting especially if they were, you know, small particles that were lofted high up."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Jay Forsythe,694.0,"Right? It it one of the hardest parts of those studies is like they get all they get tons of this data and they can do all this networking and um really cool analyses, but is actually figuring out exactly what the molecules are, right? You know, a lot of times they have to purchase the standards and run the standards and compare them to the, you know, and and that that's really the most time consuming part a lot of times of those analyses. And so I I I think this is I think this is a really this is a really tough problem. I mean, and and you know, like when we think about going from, oh, I want to look at this molecule and this molecule and this molecule to all these molecules and how they interact with one another, um, you know, like scaling that or like or or doing that kind of work on a on a rover or something is is a real challenge. Um, which is why I think I I'm obviously I'm really excited about a lot of the new experiments that are going on on the rovers, but I'm also excited about a lot of the sample return projects that are going on now because I think that the kinds of experiments we can do if we get sample back is I mean, orders of magnitude like deeper than what we can probably do elsewhere and again, it's not that that it's not that those experiments aren't useful, they're extremely useful, but I guess from my standpoint, I I like I'm I'm interested kind of more in the organic stuff too like like Ming was saying and so um I think it I think it'll be really difficult to assign like assign like when you have these really complex mixtures like assign everything and really kind of like make sense of the mess, right? And so um I don't really know where I'm going with this to be honest with you. Um I just I think I think analytically I think this is a really this is a really hard problem."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,941.0,Okay.
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Amanda Stockton,941.0,Okay.
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,647.0,"your instruments are probably at very I mean you're you're looking at incredibly high spectral resolution um which we which we can now do for exoplanet atmosphere uh the technique so far is really limited to hot giant planets. Um but it was what Natasha was saying that you're still the the signal like you don't you don't get this like exquisite beautiful spectrum where you can just see all the lines, you get something that's like stuck in the noise underneath the fact that what you're primarily seeing is the star. Um and so you make a template spectrum that has you know that that has like the various isotopologues that you think might be present and you cross correlate against the noise and by leveraging the the the power of the entire broad spectrum, you get out a signal, you get out you know there's there's there's a match and there's a better match with one with one template than another. So it it is it is possible. I'm I'm on a paper right now that has that that potentially has a um a isotope measurement in a but in like a hot Jupiter atmosphere um and it's the easy it's it's like it's CO, it's like the easiest molecule to go after."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Eliza Kempton,792.0,"For sure. I mean I think right one of the problems with exoplanets right now right but habitable habitable zone planets, habitable zone rocky planets are still like really, really challenging targets and the a big question is is how much can we learn that's useful by looking at planets that that we don't believe are habitable in the first place, right? Let's get all that context from hotter planets from bigger planets. Um and yeah, no so again so if there if there is specific useful context that any of you can can think of um that you know astronomers haven't had access to."
2021_06_11_SLU_S5,Jay Forsythe,964.0,"Yeah, I can weigh in on that paper. Um, we actually we read it in as like our our little group meeting paper a couple weeks ago. It just came out. Um, yeah, I I so I mean the technique they were using to kind of study molecular complexity was mass spectrometry. They so they would like isolate molecules and then break them into pieces and look like how many pieces do we generate and kind of correlate that to this idea of molecular complexity and and I actually I think it's a really intriguing idea. Um, I think that they're actually there could be potential types of like like more practically speaking approaches that actually might be maybe even more representative than what they used, but I think that like the I think the idea itself is actually really intriguing to me and um, yeah, I I mean I I kind of like the I like that it has like an agnostic nature kind of to it, you know, like in that like I mean I can just take any giant molecule and just blow it to shreds and just, you know, see like how many fragments do I see, right? And and it kind of does have a universe universality to it. Um, but um, yeah, I I actually I think that's a really interesting idea and and um, I'm intrigued to kind of see where they take that in the future as well. Yeah."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Lisa Kaltenegger,608.0,"Oh, yeah, but the the yes, we can also do the recorder first. We did last time we introduced each other and so people mentally got to the point where they want to volunteer."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Lisa Kaltenegger,623.0,"Okay, let's get people through the suspense of who's going to do the job now. So, uh, by"
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Lisa Kaltenegger,976.0,We can even pay for the FedEx shipping.
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Stephanie Olson,883.0,"Like I'm I'm not sure how Simon defines complex life, but if we're talking like animal grade complexity and things that might eventually become communicative, I think continents are a a clear requirement."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Christopher Hamilton,1096.0,"And so I I I think perhaps if we were to focus today's discussion, we could look at aspects of tectonics on ocean worlds, volcanism on ocean worlds, um, and how life might be able to be established and what the thresholds of complexity could be uh on ocean worlds. Um, as opposed to considering all planets because I I I I heard oceans a lot here. Um, just stemming from a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, I I I went off on a a tangent of research in in the evening trying to look more specifically at this concept that we were thinking about in terms of um considering classes of world based on the information that they contain in terms of the number of different states. And that's a a form of information, it's a information entropy. Um, but there's actually another form of information that could be very interesting uh and that's mutual information. So if you think about that in the context of an ecosystem, um if you were to look at either geological component of that ecosystem or biological component, what would be your reduction in uncertainty about knowing about the other uh actors or components by making that observation. So for instance if you saw a particular um chemical composition or if you saw a particular uh microbial uh either individual microbial species or an ecology, what is your reduction in uncertainty about other parts of that system? What what is the mutual information contained in an ecosystem and that might be another another direction."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Dimitar Sasselov,1059.0,Or will the stagnant lid will be very different in that case?
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Joseph Levy,889.0,Just to to clarify Lisa. So is the concern cycling in the ocean itself or cycling in the ocean crust mantle system?
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Joseph Levy,926.0,"Um, but it's mostly not sediment that's truly derived from the continental shelf that's failing there. It's terrestrially derived sediment that builds up on the shelf and then fails as turbidites every 500 years in Oregon. Sorry, West Coast folks. Um, so it's you know, I think that predominantly. So I I I would expect it to be very, very slow, you know, I would expect to see cross-bedded water world shales with mud and clay size sediments, but I wouldn't, you know, that and I would expect to see turbidites close to our underwater Olympus Mons. Um, but I think that's a very small fraction of of the sediment budget that you get on a mixed terrestrial aquatic world like ours."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Stephanie Olson,885.0,"I don't know, like that. Is there the potential for kind of like a gain feedback here with biological carbon export and then dissolution return somehow scaling with surface temperature."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Bradford Foley,722.0,"I think that's possible on a stagnant lid planet that doesn't have plate tectonics because then there's no real easy way. There's some kind of weird, probably hard ways, but no real easy way to recycle water back into the mantle because you don't have subduction zones. So I'd expect a stagnant lid planet and this actually would be regardless of whether it's has biology or not to you know, they could start drier at the surface and outgas water over time. Um, although we also don't know like the initial condition, you know, it might be more likely that if planets have go through a magma ocean phase that they would tend to start with volatiles out gas to the surface. Um, I know Laura would know more about that than I do. Um, but yeah, so but if you if there was some for somehow how it formed or its initial condition, the planet started dry at the surface but had water in the interior and it had a stagnant lid, I would expect it to generally just be outgassing water over time and build up an ocean but not easily recycle that back into the interior."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Simon Darroch,1057.0,"Sorry, my internet is maddeningly unstable. Trinity, what did I miss? On this planet, um, it looks as though we had multicellular life before there was anything close to modern day oxygen levels. So yeah, anything big and anything that wants to be very energetic and active does need quite a lot of oxygen. But just to be multicellular, no, you don't need huge amounts of oxygen. Um, so we come into this sort of it's question of what is simple versus complex life. If we define complex as cells acting together to do interesting things, no, I don't think we need a lawful lot of oxygen."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Christopher Hamilton,618.0,"Yeah, I have the link to the slides."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Simon Darroch,700.0,"Sorry, I just want to sort of recapitulate on your point point earlier, which is if we have life on a water world, what biological feedbacks could make that water world more habitable over time?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Lisa Kaltenegger,785.0,"I I think one of the things we haven't gotten to discussing but one of the things that I I'd be really interested in this is like maybe one of the biosphere could actually be helpful for the other biosphere or reverse. One of the biosphere will eventually kill off the other biosphere, you know, so that's kind of an interesting question. Uh is it going to be, you know, competition or or are they going to be so different that it doesn't matter, right? Like in a Titan idea, one is water based, one is methane based and so they would not interact."
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Dimitar Sasselov,856.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S4,Lisa Kaltenegger,869.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Edwin Kite,935.0,Um and uh in the solar system uh early Mars all aspects uh climate modeling uh geological data analysis that kind of thing.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Joseph Levy,1200.0,But but it's not a semantics question. I mean it's it's sort of an elegant experiment you've proposed.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Joseph Levy,686.0,"Um which is funny because right because that doesn't stop any of us from walking into that valley. Like it's quite habitable to a human uh on a short time scale. Um, but we we're unlikely to reproduce there."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Edwin Kite,708.0,"Um, so Mars is small, Mars is dead. Is Mars dead because it's small? Um, for, uh, so there's got to be a minimum mass for a planet with a habitable surface because once you get really small, you just can't hang on to water."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Christopher Reinhard,914.0,"So the ocean has a pH of like three or something. Um, and it's like the pH is low everywhere and you love low pH. Um, are you just going to are you going to kill it and like totally reshape the chemistry of the atmosphere?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Ziming Yang,1010.0,"Yeah, I agree. I think uh, you know, even on earth, you know, we have uh, you know, a variety of organisms, microorganisms that can live under those extreme environments, right? Like from very acidic to very basic pH and and also you know like the boiling point of water. So they can survive under those extreme conditions. Uh but the question I think, you know, will be uh so we only know those exist like on earth, but maybe like in outer, you know, exoplanets. So if there's life, they can also get adapted, right? So adapting to the to those specific environments, right? So they can evolve to maybe uh even like robust organisms, they can survive even more extreme environments. So that's something we don't know yet. You know, we only have earth as example, but we don't know if this is the case, you know, those are the limits for these organisms to live, right? In outer, you know, space. So yeah."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Smadar Naoz,1095.0,"There are many things that that can be that can be beneficial to look of of exomoons of giant planets. First, exomoons are big, second, the tidal interaction brings them heat."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Courtney Dressing,877.0,"Just to rephrase that a bit, are you suggesting that instead of looking at places where we think that maybe life might be more detectable, we look for the places where it might be even harder to find life or maybe harder for life to exist and we check to see if we find life there. And then if we do, that tells us that life is even more common than we might expect if we found it on a place like Enceladus or Titan."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Smadar Naoz,1156.0,Sorry.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Edwin Kite,604.0,ancient now frozen subsurface ocean. And uh specific places on series that have done this excavation for you are um the cryo uh volcanic mountain of Una Mons and um there are also uh what looks like cryo lava planes at uh crater. And then you just need to excavate below the meteoritic gardening and radiation processed layer which is maybe a couple of feet down as for Europa.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Edwin Kite,689.0,"Um, so this mission proposal, this mission is already being proposed. Uh, so for our purposes just trying to come up with new ideas, I guess we need to broaden beyond series and like think about uh how asteroid belt exploration might test these ideas. And if asteroid belt exploration will generally there ain't no liquid water today except maybe immediately after impacts. Does that answer your question, Joe? So I guess it would be prebiotic."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Smadar Naoz,604.0,about objects closer to the other star because it will move faster. So because it also depends on the on the star. This is this comes from a from a work that we showed that you can understand the volatiles that have been found on um on white dwarfs. So white dwarf pollution. I'll put the paper on.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Smadar Naoz,637.0,"Well, if the semi major axis changes, then yes, right? Semi major axis change, so the period ratio does change because the semi semi major axis ratio changes."
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Courtney Dressing,1171.0,I think that's exactly what you said that you were very enthusiastic.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Christopher Reinhard,1086.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Joseph Levy,1131.0,Right.
2021_06_11_SLU_S8,Courtney Dressing,871.0,Thank you.
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Solange Duhamel,620.0,Hello.
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Niki Parenteau,749.0,No worries.
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Noah Planavsky,676.0,I mean.
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Smadar Naoz,892.0,"I think there are some people who work on this um from different directions. One um if they are able to see some transmission within the planet's atmosphere and they can get some lines that will indicate uh some interesting uh behavior and maybe estimation on the metallicity. And another thing is um planet composition. Um, there are lots of works that try to estimate how rocky something is and then by proxy you can say, you know, we need I mean, in order to be very rocky, you need some uh some at least some metals at least. So it's very you know, it's like that but this is the most that we can do, I think so far."
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Solange Duhamel,647.0,"I think if we think about the redfield ratio in early earth, we it may be difficult to to predict in the sense that what we know today is oxygenated world and for example in the case of phosphorus, most organisms will assimilate phosphate and it was pretty rare on early earth when there was no oxygen, so we need to start looking into organisms that uh survive or make their living in um reduced environments. So we need to also think about environments that will be similar to early earth to go pick up those redfield ratios to make prediction and not necessarily in the open ocean today for example or uh other type of uh environment that are not representative of this early earth. So I think thinking of both the microbes, their processes but also their environments, everything is tied together which is also a difficulty because uh part of it is can you mimic that in the lab and uh how can how much can you simplify without losing important components that would uh artificially drive your results towards uh the wrong answer."
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Erik Sperling,1164.0,Looks like Simon.
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Smadar Naoz,823.0,"Uh, that's a good question. So it really depends. I think that if there are if there are tides and tidal heating, it can happen actually pretty quickly or very slowly. So it can happen it depends it depends first on our our our uncertainty of exactly how tides work. It also depends what is forcing the the migration, right? So if I'm moving a system from uh two orders of magnitude in semi major axis, like we're thinking that how Jupiters are moving around to become hot Jupiters, imagine that Jupiter has a moon with it, the entire system is moving and changing the energy by two orders of magnitude."
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Stilianos Louca,638.0,"One thing one modern example is heterosis in cyano. Uh, you're right that the the oxygen is is it would be uh, you know, it's a toxin in the sense that it it prevents nitrogen fixation. Uh, and yet there's so many other organisms that that could use it, but nevertheless, those cyano, their solution was to actually compartmentalize oxygen production and nitrogen fixation. Uh, so even though oxygen is so useful to many other organisms including themselves."
2021_06_10_SLU_S1,Niki Parenteau,996.0,"Yes, thank you guys. We're all fabulous. Thank you Jeff."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Daniel Huber,686.0,Yeah.
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Lisa Kaltenegger,745.0,"Oh, good thinking. Yes, should we find a note taker first?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Lisa Kaltenegger,788.0,"3.2, right?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Meredith MacGregor,1038.0,"Yeah, that's really cool. I did not actually know that either."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Daniel Huber,1190.0,"So it is it's it's metal poor and enhanced in in alpha elements. So it is um yeah, I think we're estimated in."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Andrew Vanderburg,911.0,"Well, radial velocities are pushing out to Jupiter. Right. Um, microlensing will get the further planets."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Meredith MacGregor,663.0,"Yeah, I mean I feel like there's some complexities that right like like on one hand, I think almost every disc we look at now, there's just like rings and gaps all the way down. It seems to be completely ubiquitous that every disc is just like full of structure. But then I think there's more complexities to that. And like I've been really interested in, you know, differences between like A type stars and later type stars because the A type stars are where we find all these giant directly image planets and they seem to have some slightly different disc properties like they hang on to gas for a lot longer and they have more massive discs and it seems like they might even have like different collisional properties and size distributions of bodies in their discs and so, you know, like the reach there would be to say, you know, I bet you could try and say something about like planet formation efficiency around different spectral type stars, you know, based on a variety of properties and my instinct is that there should be something there, but that we haven't gotten there yet."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Lisa Kaltenegger,867.0,"I think you would say that that sorry, that at the exoplanet modeling thing we just assume or mostly most people assume an isothermal atmosphere with like a certain composition and then you can say something."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Andrew Vanderburg,864.0,[garbled]
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Keith Hawkins,927.0,[garbled]
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Noah Planavsky,941.0,Um I mean I think it would be tough to to to I mean it would be tough to say conclusively that you do have a a lava world or not from an atmospheric signature. But I think the idea of course if you have a molten world that your volatile load is going to be in your in your atmosphere some of whatever portions we retained at least is is totally is totally fair.
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Andrew Vanderburg,633.0,"uh learn about kind of the impacts or the architectures so we can then study the impacts of those architectures on habitability. Then we started talking about um shared chemistry between different planets in the same uh way that happens in the outer solar system and moon systems. Um then we talked a little bit about um the abundances of stars and um connecting that with the abundance of planets. We talked a little bit about this in a different order. Um so we talked about the condensation temperature uh work that's been done. We talked about um spectra of lava worlds, uh white dwarf planet debris. Um and then we just recently talked about the galactic habitable zone. What do people think are the most important things that we should discuss with the group?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Andrew Vanderburg,650.0,"Yeah, Titan, Titan is the one solar system moon with a denser atmosphere than Earth."
2021_06_11_SLU_S12,Keith Hawkins,845.0,"Oh yeah, you could do it for tons of stuff in G stars."
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,659.0,"There's been an awful lot of discussion about exoplanets, but we're not limited to that of course. Um so we should think of take a wide scope in in how we view these things. How and when does does did life establish a biosphere? All origins are local by definition. How does primordial biology diversify to a point where it is robust and detectable on a planetary scale? Microbial evolution on the early earth, how did microbes spread across the early earth and affect biogeochemical cycling, evolution? How have successive waves of evolutionary innovation altered the structure and function of our planet? How long does it take our prebiotic chemistry to become biochemistry? Are there ways of bounding this problem on earth? Does the length of evolutionary time necessary for life to influence a planet's atmosphere depend on the planet's properties such as the amount of liquid water present on the surface, the thickness of the planet's atmosphere, etcetera. Okay, well now we're done, we're out of our time. So it's good to see you all. So, so that's a pretty tall order and we can unpack that a little bit. Um but before we start unpacking, let's let's go ahead and do those those introductions and don't forget to unmute yourself."
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Shannon Mackenzie | JHU APL,956.0,Great.
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,676.0,Okay.
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,1138.0,Right.
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Meredith MacGregor,670.0,"Um, you sort of said exactly what I was going to try and say in response to Rika because um, I I work on planetary system formation and trying to understand and look at these discs where something like late heavy bombardment would be actually happening now. Um, because we can see that around other planetary systems, right? So we can go and we can image these discs that are, you know, tens of millions to hundreds of millions to billions of years old and we can actually see the dynamics of them um in real time. And so um, the different look at late heavy bombardment instead of just looking at the crater counts but trying to understand like the dynamics of planetary systems and discs. Um, and it's complicated and tricky. Um, there's a few things that I think are interesting and of note here and that, you know, our solar system actually has a lot less excess stuff hanging around in it than the typical exoplanetary system. Um, so um, we have a disc that remains, which is the Kyper belt and the asteroid belt and it's pretty mass poor and by mass poor I mean like orders of magnitude less comets and asteroids than, you know, the typical exoplanetary system that we look at. Um, so it's sort of an interesting case to consider in terms of like, you know, whether we had a late heavy bombardment, but when we look at exoplanetary systems, we're looking at a completely different dynamic. There's just so much more stuff, which means more collisions, which means more dynamics, which means more things getting thrown around. Um, and I I'm really always struck from an astrophysical perspective by kind of how things like this can both be necessary but also incredibly harmful, right? Like this is a lot of things that I work on, you know, like discs in terms of bringing water to the planet in the first place, but then, you know, too many impacts and you start killing things or stellar flares might be necessary to give you UV, but maybe that's too much and you start destroying things. And so my question then has always been like, you know, I can study these from astrophysical phenomenon and I can come up with rates and predictions and dynamics and things like that, but then, you know, how robust is life actually? Because I don't have a good sense for that. Like can life handle an increase of some amount or not, right? And and that's I'm really curious to hear from biologists like, you know, how robust is life in actuality to these sorts of transient events."
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,918.0,"It depends on where you are, right? If it's an exoplanet, it's going to be a microbial byproduct. It's going to be a gas in an atmosphere. Um and almost all of these gases have abiotic sources as well, right? So one of the things for earth is this transition from impact related serpentinization and a wide range of abiotic processes that yield methane to when to when life took over. Um so it's a question of do you need life to get a lot of methane or can geology do that?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Stilianos Louca,1053.0,Um.
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Rika Anderson,999.0,"So I have a question actually, that's really interesting because so you're saying that the larger stars we probably don't have we're not going to have much luck there because they're so short lived. But then on the other end of the spectrum, we have M stars which are incredibly long lived, but from what I understand because they're so close, they're going to be tidally locked and so you may end up with only a small ring of habitability around the edges."
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,1024.0,tidally locked planet. I've never really thought about that before. Um why would it why would there not be winds and atmospheric mixing? What what are the pressure gradients atmospherically? Have people worked on that?
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,629.0,"Yeah, I mean techno signatures there's a wide range and there's a pretty big community that cares about that includes things like like gases in the atmosphere that would by our understanding not have a biological source. There are light relationships, there are many things, radio signals. Um, but there are also other classes of things like the red edge which can be very strongly related to terrestrial biomass um on our planet, grasses and trees and the like vegetation on land areas, uh algae in the ocean. So there are pigment classes as well. Many of the much of the focus has been on bacterial pigments in the surface ocean as being potentially detectable. That's a challenging field but it's certainly a possibility. There would be other things living in the ocean that might be detectable in a pigment sense. Look at chlorophyll on our own planet. Um, so a lot of it is is prokaryotic uh and impacts on atmospheric gases but it's not exclusively that. Um, if would someone else like to say something we have actually only about five minutes and I it's this would be the time where I would ask Jen if you have uh in an organized sense things that you want to be able to report out."
2021_06_11_SLU_S3,Timothy W Lyons,695.0,Okay.
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Anat Shahar,607.0,Yes.
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Mathieu Lapotre,865.0,"Um it's a it's a very good question and it's I don't think it's one that has a an easy answer, right? Because life can do both. It can enhance erosion and it can uh uh also slow it down. It depends what part of landscape you're at and what kind of biological process you're looking into. Uh if you're on a hill slope and you have trees that tend to fall, you know, they'll promote slowly erosion. Um but if you colonize a flood plane with um you know, shrubs, you're going to stabilize the banks and prevent erosion. Um microbes tend to stabilize things as well, but they can also promote uh and accelerate um silicate weathering, right? So there is kind of this dual um effect that life can have on on erosion, yeah."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Morgan Cable,599.0,"last point I wanted to bring up was just like you're doing an Institute bio signature detection um you know campaign, you would want to include multiple independent tests uh for life. And so some of the tests that Matthew is proposing could certainly fall on that list. And so I think if we are able to come up with you know a handful of completely orthogonal techniques to interrogate a world on a planetary scale in this context that that could also be very powerful."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Mathieu Lapotre,765.0,"Well, so going back to um our ability to so I guess beyond our ability to detect uh to detect it in the sense of, you know, is there enough life that we can see it? Um, I guess it kind of goes back to uh one of the keynotes which we kind of need to understand what the default of that planet would be if there was not if there wasn't life, right? In order to be able to um say something because because some planets might have some indicator of that could be interpreted as biotic, but on that planet it's completely abiotic, right? And so we kind of need to first develop an understanding of what should this planet look like if there was no life and then try to identify deviations from from that state."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Christopher Hamilton,945.0,"I don't think there I mean there's always one out there, right? That there's a planet that would have begun in an oxidizing state as opposed to a reducing state but but I think that would be an extraordinary exception and not the not the norm."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Laura Schaefer,1032.0,one
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Gregory Fournier,1079.0,"As as far as we understand, the reason why it accumulates on earth and we get this battery where we have all this buried reduced carbon and this very oxidized atmosphere is because is because there's a means for efficient burial of organic carbon over large geological time scales."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Christopher Hamilton,773.0,"So, um there are some fundamental differences. Ocean worlds might get a head start, but they might actually be capped in terms of the complexity just because they're they're missing some of these other environmental niches that that are needed uh both from a uh evolutionary standpoint but also just for the uh biogeochemical uh complexity that would be present on that world and therefore biomarkers."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Anat Shahar,802.0,"Not ranting, it's very interesting. It's great."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Anat Shahar,607.0,"Yes, comparative planetology, that's right. Planet size and there was a lot of discussion about initial conditions of those planets. That's right."
2021_06_10_SLU_S6,Shannon MacKenzie,928.0,"But if it's more like Mars, the the dust storms are like more global, whereas Titan it was this patchy thing."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Shawn Domagal,775.0,And then that might help people frame or put into context their introduction because I think what would be great is if people could talk about how they approach the question that I'm just about to mention.
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Shawn Domagal,821.0,"Popcorn is like you all decide who you call on the next person to to talk. Oh, that's nice. Until everyone's spoken. So G, you you pick who goes next."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Daniel Huber,863.0,"Um but I think a lot about uh sort of the connection between stars and exoplanets. I hear a bit of feedback. I'm not sure if you do that too. So anyway, I'll keep going. Um and so in terms of bio signatures, I don't necessarily, you know, look for bio signatures myself, but I think about um the uh again, the connection between how can we use properties of stars who we might find exoplanets around um to inform the probability of actually detecting our planets with bio signatures on them."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Nathaniel Gabor,681.0,"And and and all of those, right? You would say it would have to have A B C D and E. And so that to me is like a really interesting way to think about biosignatures is actually predicting uh beforehand that life would be on a given planet with some basic inputs. And I think that's really challenging, but that would be the the kind of uh that would be the the holy grail, I think for me. That would be really interesting."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Betül Kaçar,898.0,Paula.
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Timothy W Lyons,801.0,ramped up a bit when we start to bring samples back from Mars but we'll be relatively simple observations and and and have the confidence that we need given how hard it is to do even on early earth. So what would be the what would be the perfect thing if you could find it within the limits of technical abilities now and as we foresee in coming decades.
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Nathaniel Gabor,820.0,"Well, I mean that there's I don't think there's not any that you would call specifically um a bio signature other than how it correlates to other things. So for instance like um if I saw that there were uh there was some particular way that climate was being altered."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Maggie Osburn,900.0,"And then as more of a microbial ecologist, you know, one of the hats I wear some days, um, there's this concept of bio reticulation or patterning that is characteristic of biology looking at more of like like the kind of hand sample scale, you know, so it's like what can you see from from far space from orbital space from outcrop scale down a hand sample scale down to microbe scale. And so we're talking about detectability across a range of spatial and sometimes temporal scales. Um, and so what I was bringing up in the in the chat was this idea of these reticulated structures um and particularly in places like caves and in the subsurface where we don't have photosynthesis happening, um, something one thing we do still get is this weird organization, like spatial organization of biomass and other kinds of signatures um in terms of Amanda brought on the idea of like, you know, what what sorts of element and um sort of polymer signatures are correlative to those spatial distributions."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Richard Wiener,766.0,"They extended it to 11:50, so I'll broadcast uh right now something about that."
2021_06_10_SLU_S7,Timothy W Lyons,890.0,"I I would just add that I think the comparative planetology of Venus, Earth and Mars is incredibly fruitful because from a distance certainly Venus and Earth look the same until you start getting atmospheres and there's a lot to be learned about how they both went bad and we didn't. Um right? Because they probably started in very similar places."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Amanda Stockton,818.0,and we would expect more enrichment of heavier isotopes if it's more of a thermodynamic process with radical chemistry. Is that am I delineating this correctly?
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Amanda Stockton,903.0,So
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Maggie Osburn,917.0,"the risk of further steering this towards my own thoughts. Um I'll tell you about a project that I I just got funded um that obviously is is NSF fundable so therefore not crazy enough but could be a feeder. So it's um doing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotopes of amino acids derived from uh protein from subsurface ecosystems essentially to track different parts of trophic relationships between microbes within deep subsurface environments. And the reason to do that is because the input carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen comes from different places and as many of you know, of course, when these amino acids are being synthesized, it's going through different biochemical pathways. And so nitrogen isotopes are canonically used to track fractionation, uh trophic ladders, uh hydrogen isotopes reflect something about water, but also something about central metabolism, um whereas carbon isotopes are fairly complex in amino acid uh space. And so it's possible to measure all three. Um there's also people doing and not me, but people with bigger mass specs um who are doing um position specific isotopes. So like what does this particular carbon look like on this amino acid? Um that work is still very hard. So you have to be like, I'm going to focus just on glycine and glycine from this pool and um selecting that out. But part of me like listening to to Jay talk um about, you know, uh proteinzation and sort of doing some of these things abiotically, I would be really interested to think about sort of the the discrimination of an abiotic system compared to the discrimination of a biological system while polymerizing amino acids because that's what both of those systems do. So you can think about simple microbial systems compared to fully abiotic systems and somewhere in between."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Amanda Stockton,1103.0,"And um I'm pretty sure that we have that sort of data from uh Maggie and Morgan. I don't know if you guys looked directly at amino acids, but maybe that's in the literature. I'm seeing some nods. So if we were then able to apply some of these um tools that we use in biology to um understand how different groups are different from each other um with different correlations and things like that, would we be able to perhaps piece apart what at least on earth looks like living versus non-living um and what is prebiotic on the way to to living if we're doing some of these more directed evolution type experiments with or chemical evolution type experiments?"
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Andro Rios,742.0,"So analogous to what um like Glavin and them are doing with the the extensive alteration of the meteorites compared to an antimeric enrichment of amino acids. But in your case you're talking about the the history of which is this is good. Yeah, I mean I don't know, it sounds like this is something that someone could have done before, but maybe not. Maybe it's something that's that's that's something that is possible. But yeah, the the history of the aquis alteration and map it out according to uh the the isotopic enrichment. That sounds like something that's quite feasible. It looks like you froze, I don't know or maybe I froze."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Eliza Kempton,597.0,"of multiple molecules, I mean ones that you mentioned, methane, CO, CO2, um, and at very high spectral resolution, those those isotopic lines do they they they separate. Um, the question though, I mean I don't think anyone's done this yet really is um, is is to look at the magnitude of expected signatures. Um, I mean so we can, you know, Natasha as well like you know, we can simulate if there was an input, we could simulate it and see uh what the what the expected observable signature is, what the magnitude is and and exactly how far off from I mean it's not uh not going to be detectable today, but how far off are we from it is is there a measurement that one could make with a 30 meter class telescope or is this going to require uh you know, 100 meter telescope, something something, you know, far off in the future. It would be interesting to look into. We just basically need the predictions on our end."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Morgan Raven,835.0,"Well, I feel like this is probably relatively far off, but this is my sulfur bias coming through basically is I'm thinking about how might you actually get multiple sulfur bearing phases lofted up into the atmosphere that would be at high enough detection to ever see and some of them might be like cloud condensation nuclei or something like that. Um, sulfate aerosols, things like that."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Tori Hoehler,861.0,"Yeah, I was going to say Morgan"
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Morgan Raven,919.0,Morgan
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Tori Hoehler,881.0,"I think I think there's a really neat observation in there, which is that that these two fields have have almost necessarily sort of developed to think in very different ways about these things, right? Because the observables are are so different. And in the case of what you can observe in exoplanet science, I think, you know, the information content is really in the system, not in the individual molecules necessarily that you're looking at and and so, you know, that's that's where you begin to see the patterns or, you know, or in observing multiples of those systems and in situ, we look at things often in a very different way where the information can be in an individual observation."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Amanda Stockton,971.0,Okay.
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Amanda Stockton,1087.0,They're done in the radio.
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Jay Forsythe,1137.0,Go ahead.
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Eliza Kempton,618.0,"your instruments are probably at very I mean you're you're looking at incredibly high spectral resolution, um, which we which we can now do for exoplanet atmospheres, uh, the technique so far is really limited to hot giant planets. Um, but it was what Natasha was saying that you're still the the signal like you don't you don't get this like exquisite beautiful spectrum where you can just see all the lines, you get something that's like stuck in the noise underneath the fact that what you're primarily seeing is the star. Um, and so you make a template spectrum that has, you know, that that has like the various isotopologues that you think might be present and you cross correlate against the noise and by leveraging the the the power of the entire broad spectrum, you get out a signal, you get out, you know, there's there's there's a match and there's a better match with one with one template than another. So it it is it is possible. I'm I'm on a paper right now that has that that potentially has a um a isotope measurement in a but in like a hot Jupiter atmosphere, um, and it's easy it's it's like it's CO, it's like the easiest molecule to go after. Um, so it's it's the the concept is being proven."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Tori Hoehler,1017.0,"Oh, sorry."
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Tori Hoehler,645.0,Okay.
2021_06_11_SLU_S2,Tori Hoehler,787.0,"Yes, I think we have to have some big summary points and then we need to put that into the the presentation."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Tori Hoehler,701.0,You do have a buy.
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Jeffrey Marlow,704.0,"Jeff, you're claiming a buy also."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Tori Hoehler,733.0,"Terrible, spectacular, you know, it's it's all it's all a continuum."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Timothy W Lyons,882.0,"Although an anaerobic environment's not really an extreme, you know."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Timothy W Lyons,812.0,"any of them, but maybe the most recent one."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Timothy W Lyons,1036.0,"Amanda, could you talk a little bit about the range of conditions? So the thing that keeps jumping into my head is temperature. Um so I mean in terms of parameters that can turn down turn off these organic reactions or shift one from one to another."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Amanda Stockton,626.0,Right.
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Amanda Stockton,713.0,"Okay, that is a wonderful question. And I don't necessarily claim that I have the expertise to address it fully, but I can take a stab. Um, so I really like this idea of sliding that temperature extreme up to the point where chemical um recognition now becomes more covalent than Vander walls interactions. Um, you you could envision a world like that where like double bonds are the main background uh backbone that is holding things together. Um, but uh recognition comes through covalent bonds type of a thing. That's a total pipe dream. I don't know that that could ever possibly exist. But could you calculate from thermodynamics the limit at which you could no longer get a carbon carbon double bond, a carbon carbon single bond, a carbon carbon triple bond? Yes, that that is calculable."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Aaron Engelhart,985.0,Go ahead.
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Leslie Rogers,745.0,"Yeah, the terminology is kind of a mess and different papers use different terminology. Um, but yeah, the I guess you'd be more probably more correct calling kind of the planets between one and 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 earth radii kind of super earth because they might be kind of scaled up rocky planets. And then the ones larger kind of from 1.6 to four earth radii kind of Neptunes or sub Neptunes, but they may not be actual ice giants, like we don't know how much like whether they're just like rocky material with hydrogen helium or did they kind of create a bunch of ices from beyond the snow line."
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Christopher Hamilton,976.0,I I think you you're perhaps more likely to have um a a very uh more likely detection with an extreme monoculture than than a complex ecology that's able to better self regulate.
2021_06_11_SLU_S13,Christopher Hamilton,675.0,"So aquifer being water, absolutely not. Um aquifer being composed of sulfur that um is behaving as a fluid in the subsurface much like terrestrial aquifers do with water. Yes. Um but but for the most part the indication is IO is bone dry. And I think it would be a pretty remarkable series of uh events that would allow uh IO's subsurface to remain active today. Possible, but probably very unlikely. The key point I was making is that IO could have been habitable at an earlier time when it wasn't the hellish world it is now or it could be habitable in a future time to something else that favors energy over an otherwise hostile environment."
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Kristin Koutmou,836.0,Yeah. I am Kristen Koutmou. I'm at the University of Michigan. I am a biochemist and my lab is interested in
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Cheryl Andam,857.0,Sorry.
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Wilfred van der Donk,917.0,"So so coming back to my question, is there a depository? Is there so so you you clearly present data that is out there for parasites focusing in this case on the host to to predict susceptibility. But are there are there databases there either for the parasites or for"
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Wilfred van der Donk,977.0,"Those of you that are working on on the viruses. So I understand that the databases are there, but you essentially had to mind that database for your own work."
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Wilfred van der Donk,730.0,"Yeah, I I don't know of any programs like that too. I have a feeling that in the next year we're going to find out a lot of uh data that hasn't been accumulated in the past year and that people are now looking at from actually infection with with COVID. Uh but I think those studies are hard and and probably lengthy is my guess. Uh but I know we were talking yesterday in the reception a little bit. Here at Illinois, we started doing testing of all the students and all the staff twice a week mandatory last summer. And so that means that there is a whole year of data of about 53,000 people that were all tested twice a week. I I hope because all of that data is there that uh that this will be mined for all kinds of different uh uh uh parameters. Um I don't know if we will have enough data of the people that tested positive and if we have all of that information on host, host immunity, transcriptomics, uh epigenetics, my guess is probably not. but but if the samples were frozen, uh maybe, maybe we can go back and can do a lot of analyses of these positive cases. And of course, patient wide and globally, there's a lot of samples that can be looked at retrospectively for things we don't know. And so maybe making a list of what would be good things to look at that either people are already looking at or perhaps not because we don't know what other people are doing. That could be a very valuable uh way of using resources that are already perhaps out there."
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Joyce Jose,600.0,"any of these things. I mean, I am only talking about the viruses I am familiar with, but"
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Dana Mitzel,885.0,Yes.
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Joyce Jose,960.0,"in along with pull down studies and mass spectrometry. These are very useful. So Joyce, you you mean if you use specific inhibitors for GTPases, you actually see blockage of the virus replication or"
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Dana Mitzel,629.0,So there is a little metabolomics data coming out with viruses. Um also something we're interested in trying to start up. Um more in like the metabolomics in insects versus mammalian cells and stuff like that.
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Cheryl Andam,821.0,Okay.
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Kristin Koutmou,929.0,"Sure, so innate immune response."
2021_10_01_MZT_S11,Danae Schulz,1051.0,Thank you.
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Linda Detwiler,840.0,"Oh you're on mute, Kim. You're mute."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Adela Oliva Chavez,1091.0,"Uh so I'm interested in molecular mechanisms that make them be capable of making that jump. Uh so acquiring genes, uh changing receptors, etc. So all those molecular mechanisms that allow pathogens to make that jump into a new host."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Adela Oliva Chavez,1122.0,"Yeah, I don't know what bot two is."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kezia Manlove,1022.0,"All right, I'll just applaud."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kim Pepin,880.0,"I'm I'm super biased when it comes to spillover. I think like the ecology is the most important thing because if you don't have contact, you don't it doesn't matter. You know what I mean? Like you just the virus is not going to get to that new host. And so like that interface between species is critical to understand and the ecology that drives it."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Matthew Hopken,601.0,with different pathogens. And then sometimes we often make the assumption that pathogens that are more closely related to each other are more likely to affect the same type of host. Well we also see that's not often the case. So I think there's these huge data gaps and um a classic one I often think about too is like the bluetongue virus is the predictability of it moving with climate change has been it's been assumed that vectors in an area if they're not phylogenetically related to the current vector that they're not going to be able to transmit that. But that was actually shown in Europe in the late 2000s that the virus completely jumped to another species of biting midge that was not even closely related phylogenetically and it was assumed throughout Europe that none of these vectors were actually um none of these species were actually able to transmit the virus and that testing was all based on just phylogenetic predictions. Um so I think evolutionary history being a component of this can be informative um and in context with ecology too and so I go often go back to what Kim's talking about different data types and how can these data types be joined in some type of predictive model and weighted based on the different systems to lead to a predictive outcome.
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kim Pepin,727.0,"You're on mute, Kezia. I see that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kim Pepin,874.0,"I completely agree with Kezia. I just want to say that, but I'm going to change the topic slightly. Um, I want to go back to thinking about how to bridge these scales. So we have all this research that's been going on for years with trying to predict how viruses evolve in different microclimate conditions."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kim Pepin,912.0,Yeah.
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Troy Sutton,656.0,"I I can add some context to that. So, um, you know, we were talking about including humans in the ecological models. I think that's a huge factor because you don't get spillover if humans don't go out and handle these animals and change our behaviors and avian influence is an example of that where um the H5N1 virus you're talking about evolved in a certain area of China. It's at a lake where they started I I don't know if the farms preexisted but they started farming a lot of animals in and around these lakes where migratory birds were coming in and landing. And so you had birds living, you know, domesticated birds which people are living in very close proximity with their birds that are being exposed to wild birds and that um, you know, H5N1 won the lottery, it had the right features to then uh infect humans and highly pathogenic avian influenza only evolves in chickens. It does not evolve in wild birds. So that was where actually the the chicken, the human behavior of raising all of these chickens actually um led to evolution of that virus that then have farther downstream um effects. Um, so I I I think human behavior is probably the only way we're going to get a handle on some of this because we cannot just we we don't have the resources to monitor every wild animal out there. Um but we can we can follow humans especially with our wonderful use of cell phones and things like that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Adela Oliva Chavez,1098.0,"Yeah, like doing something. So you can identify metabolic markers, you can do like metabolomics in in like uh specific host of interest and identify markers that change when the that specific host is highly infected and it could become like a super spreader. Uh, so you could look for uh metabolic uh metabolic markers. You can look also like because we know even in humans the depending on the metabolism, you have different processes like a person that has obesity tends to have a stronger inflammatory response than a person that is lean and exercise. Uh, so we can look for things like that in the in the ecological landscape. Um, to see okay, what like what host in this ecological landscape are more likely to become infected and what is the metabolism of that host and how does that influence that they become super spreaders and like more likely to then uh aid in that spillover event."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Matthew Hopken,601.0,"at times to um the metabolism as well. Different organisms metabolize differently and some of that metabolism is also tied to diet, right? So if some of that you can get us a picture of the organism's overall health by looking at its microbiome. Okay, thank you."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Kim Pepin,651.0,"That I wasn't exactly thinking that. I that far ahead. I was actually thinking like, you know, for a given species that we might do surveillance on, you know, identifying spatially, using these indicators to identify spatially where you might most be at risk for high levels of transmission, but then yeah, I think you'd want other data streams like the human component to know like whether that hotspot of transmission in that reservoir species would be high risk to humans. That's just what I was thinking. I don't know about everybody else."
2021_10_01_MZT_S2,Adela Oliva Chavez Oliva Chavez,695.0,"Uh, and we know from other studies in other places that it has to do a lot with the uh biofilms in the mid gut. Uh, so that that makes me wonder if something like that happens in vertebral animals where if you have a specific microbiome in your skin, you have a different immune response and then tickborn pathogens cannot infect. Uh, maybe something like that happens in other places in our body, uh, and yeah, it's a good question. Nobody has looked at the microbiome and how that affects the establishment uh of certain pathogens."
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,William Witola,634.0,"Yeah, yeah, it appears to be not specific for a particular pathogen, but it kind of targets intracellular pathogens, particularly those pathogens that form uh like a vacuum once they get into a host cell because it's that vacuum that those peptides tend to latch onto and then on top of pyroptosis they also activate acidification of the vacuum which also tends to kill the intracellular pathogens."
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Angad Mehta,597.0,capping RNA polymerase dependent RNA replication and lot of the small molecules scaffolds as I think Peter had pointed out right in the beginning tend to be sort of generic right like Remdesivir was never really developed for SARS COV2 it was developed for like HCV and Ebola right and so I think there are mechanisms beyond just receptor targeting that can be essentially targeted to develop what one what might be more broad spectrum therapies.
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,William Witola,694.0,"And then there are certain features on this uh nanoparticle that allows it to uh readily penetrate uh cell membranes and get into the cytoplasm or even into the uh nucleus. That way then you can actually uh target your peptides to the actual uh pathogen in the cell. So that that can be like a delivery mechanism. And uh if you do it that way, it's like the RNA vaccine that's being used against uh uh COVID, uh whereby you're not just introducing peptides, but you are introducing coding sequences that once they get into the cell, you know, uh they'll express uh, you know, the actual proteins or the actual peptides in uh significant amounts."
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Gisselle Medina,802.0,"Um, I think the the something that is universal is to activate these um pathogen uh recognizing molecules. So those can be activated by different ways even utilizing pieces of the bacteria itself so that the cells can be activated and then induce uh the interferon. But interferon using the adenovirus uh platform has been very successful for some viruses. I'm not sure for others, yes."
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Angad Mehta,1034.0,But most of them are sort of post cellular entry uh mechanisms. And so uh the the pathogen has to get within the cell and then one has to target the host cell to actually uh prevent the replication from occurring.
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Danae Schulz,1161.0,Yes.
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Angad Mehta,788.0,But we don't really have a system for intracellular pathogens for example. There's no system as yet for RNA polymerase and so I think uh uh I I I don't have enough space to write all of this down.
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Angad Mehta,803.0,"Oh make the font smaller? Okay, let's do that."
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Angad Mehta,1004.0,And so these are not really standalone proteins unfortunately which makes it harder to to predict. I can write for for what we do.
2021_09_30_MZT_S3,Peter Dorhout,1040.0,"Thank you. So this is this has been a wonderful conversation for I think for pretty much everybody in here. This has been your your first experience with a silog I'm assuming. So um the the rest of the the events throughout the course of the you know the next half day, you know the rest today and and then of course going into tomorrow we're going to be very similar in terms of conversation."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Kezia Manlove,819.0,"Yeah, and I think that's a place where, you know, like contact in particular, I think fundamentally diverges in some sense from what Guillaume was saying about, you know, depending on how resources defined, I suppose, but as as movement is being fundamentally responsive to resources, which is true if you're thinking maybe about densities, but maybe not true if you're thinking about direct interaction, which is perhaps more um more dependent upon social forces or, you know, yeah, interspecific interactions. So I wonder if it's possible that um that, you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific kinds of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease. We might. But I but I don't know."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Andrew Feig,963.0,"So if you were thinking about how you would change the way movement is measured, obviously radio frequency tagging has been done for decades, right? Um um how do we take this to the next level in terms of being able to understand which movements are relevant for disease transmission or risk of disease transmission."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Kezia Manlove,825.0,"Well, I'll take them somewhere else and fill them in in a minute."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Lauren Charles,885.0,"Um, it will also help us understand control measures that could be used and put in place if we, you know, see hot areas of where, um, you know, there's a lot of interface between humans and animals or the high risk animals, um, I think that would be important as well as, um, say understanding I think we would also need to know, um, have some sort of surveillance and understanding of what the disease is the the relative amount in those populations, um, in addition to, you know, the normal disease parameters."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau,961.0,I'll
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Mike Wimberly,708.0,"If I could just uh quickly interject, I've I've been listening and you definitely have a some themes emerging here. I I think in terms of the scale issue, you know, I'm hearing a lot of consensus about the value of, you know, individual animal level studies. Um, you know, potentially there's value even in, you know, doing more of those tracking individual animals uh, you know, over time in terms of uh, you know, maybe infection by various pathogens. And you you know, there's a need for, you know, those very detailed uh and precise measurements to often, you know, to be able to disentangle uh the complexities of a local disease transmission cycle. Um, often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. the other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. you know, it's not going to be I think it's we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful, you know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes. being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years. Um, you know, when particular species might be moving, how those might be shifting from year to year. So, uh anyway, I I just wanted to try to um, you know, try to frame some of those ideas in terms of where I hear you all going. But uh, I'll kind of put it back to the the group now."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau,729.0,Yeah.
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Kezia Manlove,782.0,"But real world I mean at least the systems that I work on they they they're behaviorally mediated frequency dependent, right? So like it's not as it would be nice, right? But I and I think there might be systems where you could do it, but I think it's hard like I I think there's a strong assumption associated with partitioning."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Avery Strait,922.0,"Um we can track you mean like if they have a big piece of land and like dairies, they'll have like multiple multiple pens. And so they're in they're up close pen, they're getting ready to calf out. They're going to be over here. Once they calf out, they're going to the calf is going to go into this pen and the animal is going to go into that pen. At very well regulated dairies, yes, they do have that information. Um and they do track it, but if they don't keep solid records, which is sometimes hard to find, um you can't trace it within the farm."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Liliana Salvador,687.0,"No, no, please go."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Mark Wilber,807.0,"I don't think this quite answers that question. Um that's a really good question. Um I I think one of the challenges with that is sort of how you partition your scales. So if you kind of imagine it where you have, you know, a bunch of like like nodes on the landscape. Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discreet where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about find the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cow is moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard metapopulation, um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes."
2021_09_30_MZT_S2,Lauren Charles,886.0,"Um so what kind of species? The pathogen species or the sorry. Yeah, I mean host or pathogen or both. So I think the host it's possible. Um I I've shown that in some things. I think with the pathogen because of all of the different transmissions, I don't think one model I I don't know. I I've been working in like classes of pathogens and building models for that because some of them require so many different species and so many different um, you know, environmental factors and climate factors it's I don't know. I think it's good to categorize things but I'm not a fan of a one all solution for everything because I don't I don't think that's possible."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Rebecca Smith,865.0,And if you get outside of Chicago uh it's only in the cities really.
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Sen Pei,1075.0,Maybe we want to simulate a wide range of disease outbreaks and pick pick those ones that can pick up the most of those future possible outbreaks.
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Paola Boggiatto,976.0,"Um and I believe all of that is being basically fed into a system that is measuring, you know, I don't know every 15 minutes, right? This the system is collecting data on a particular animal. It's feeding into an algorithm and then when there're changes in that pattern of behavior for that animal, it can flag of, you know, the manager, the supervisor and said there could be something wrong with that animal so at least it it keys you into you may not know what's wrong, but you know that something is not right. Um it's sort of that signal is coming to you. But again, I think the technology is there, it just needs to be developed and going back to, you know, how I started this conversation in terms of the infrastructure, right? Uh how are we going to pay for that? How are we going to pay for the, you know, the sensors that need to read um so there's quite a bit there, but I think the technology is working in that direction and at least in human medicine that's certainly taking off."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Brenda Rubenstein,1048.0,"Um you know, big picture would be, okay, animals can be implanted with the sensor that detects pathogen X. Um and anytime that animal comes into feed or comes into get a drink of water, there's just send, you know, there's a reader there that's measuring that response, right? So that way you don't have to go out into the field or into your barn space to detect that pathogen. Um it's sort of that signal is coming to you."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Bethany McGregor,914.0,Yeah.
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Crystal Hepp,991.0,"And so with that many traps, if if they had like that kind of surveillance where it was just right away instead of the two days it takes to do, you know, the the preparation, the RTQ PCR, that would be quite an advancement."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Bethany McGregor,1046.0,"I mean in transmission experiments I've done in the past, I mean there in some of these um sugar or um salivary collections I do, you get logs of virus from some of these mosquitoes. So you're getting a pretty significant deposition of virus when when they're salivating."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Laurene Tetard,722.0,"Yeah, so it could be antibody based unless uh you know there's another marker that could be found to to do that effect."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,A Ali Yanik,653.0,"Uh, because that often actually uh ends up being uh a lot of ambiguity in there. Uh, you know, especially uh since you simplify it so much that, you know, now you have five problems to solve. You're dealing with these five parameters, versus you have a complex technology, you start to simplify it, you bring it down. Uh, and that's actually pretty much what we observe in semiconductor technologies. Now they can make things like chemically impossible to synthesize, you know, uh at the scale comparable to tens of atoms, you know."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Laurene Tetard,995.0,And so uh um then the technology we have to um envision is going to change and so uh um there has to be discussions there to also understand what the precision surveillance would mean meaning maybe there's a rough surveillance that has to take place first before the precision can come into play.
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Paola Boggiatto,1127.0,"Is that going to really do any good to you? I guess is what I'm trying to say. It is developing a technology that is not going to be deployable, going to be useful in the end, right? So I think that's when you you approach it the opposite way. You approach, you know, what's the problem? What are we trying to to develop and then take into consideration those cultural norms, um, you know, and and and then sort of turn it around, right? So it doesn't become necessarily a scientific problem, right? It becomes a social cultural issue."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Adela Oliva Chavez,662.0,"Uh because one of the things that we were discussing is that it's impossible to uh monitor all species, all wild species in the in in the world. It would take too much uh money and too many resources. So to identify specific um host that are important in important in this spillover event and using uh artificial intelligence to then create dynamic models that look at all these different variables to make these predictions."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Maria Fernandez,931.0,"I mean the social determinants of health will impact exposure and susceptibility and and I think that it's not often discussed is like once the host is infected, let's say human, uh what do they do with that? So the probability of recovering from that infection, uh let's say uh seek health care and getting even diagnosed. Um so it plays into actually different routes, it's not just susceptibility."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Mark Wilber,1034.0,"Um and I think you know obviously it's just like, oh no spillover. That seems somewhat unrealistic. So how and it's a kind of a rare event for something like coronavirus. Like how do we determine that we have done something successfully?"
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Christine K Johnson,1055.0,"Um and is a huge issue because we're all striving for prevention, um but how do you know that you prevented something? I I don't know and I I feel like it makes a lot of our efforts seem like we haven't done anything yet we could be very successful and we have no idea."
2021_10_01_MZT_S3,Linda Detwiler,896.0,"So we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um so, you know, possibly using sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposit deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Joyce Jose,783.0,"intervention in a household or in a I I guess it depends on on the context. Like we cannot think about just one intervention that it's going to work across even if we're talking about the same rural settings, like it's also going to depend on the cultural aspects of the population at risk."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Joyce Jose,991.0,"So I think um knowing not only the virus is there, but what virus is there? What mutation? What variants specifically? Like you can talk about tick born pathogens, mosquito born pathogens and they are there are different like we know that same type of virus is transmitted by one vector but not with another vector and what is the bottleneck of these vector specificity and that contributes to the transmission as well. So I think um knowing the virus or knowing the pathogen and its variations is important."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Troy Clavell Sutton,554.0,"solution. The the solution right now is, oh, it's infected a person, we better characterize it. Um, and one of the breakout sessions I mentioned it, one of the problems we have is that we're also a little hand tied right now in terms of the the types of experiments we can do to uncover is a new virus a threat or what happened if this changed, would it cause a problem. Um, so there has to be a bit of a a change in our mentality towards how we view these viruses and um, and a change in how we allocate resources. I think there is good news. I think um, you know, the Sears influenza network has focused its resources on more of these animal human interfaces instead of just going out and sampling birds in Delaware Bay endlessly. Now we're focusing on you know, animal interfaces, um, but again still we're stuck trying to translate that knowledge."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Matthew Hopken,786.0,"Right, and those farmers you could probably sample if if that's say your focal point, you could also sample the livestock as well. They're somewhat sentinel."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Matthew Hopken,1034.0,"Yeah, so I'd like to add to both of those points that um because one is interesting point which is not necessarily depopulation but these discussions about like gene drive systems and are genetically modified organisms part of what we consider our interruption to these transmission chains and however everyone feels about that it's all pretty brand new um but it seems to have promise. And then thinking because there's a number of modelers in here, thinking about incorporating multiple types of data sets together into a single predictive model and these can be disparate types of models. some researchers in in my uh at my research center have done some work with um skunk rabies and they were able to show that both case data, you know, just positive individuals and then the subset of those being genetic sequences and then the phylogeography of those genetic sequences both predicted the wave front and the wave speed equally well with each other into a single model. They both in a single model and they both independently. And so coming up with multiple ways to sample. We don't always have to rely on genetic sequencing. Can we come up with something that is sort of a proxy sample that helps us understand these kind of wave fronts and transmissions and helps us get in front of that and then and then have this intervention moment early on."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Joyce Jose,614.0,"That's right, yeah."
2021_09_30_MZT_S5,Joyce Jose,792.0,Data analysis.
2021_10_01_MZT_S8,Curt Horvath,650.0,normally in the case where there is an infect an acute infection already diagnosed because it seems like the innate I know they did this like for BCG and oral polio things like that this kind of stimulates non specific innate immunity. It must wear off.
2021_10_01_MZT_S8,Curt Horvath,1037.0,"You know, one of the things that has to happen if you're if you have it for even a new um strain of flu that you're trying to grow grow up for live vaccine, the first thing has to be done has to be a uh you know, passage through eggs where most flu vaccine is grown, which actually does attenuate it by the time that virus which is egg adapted comes out if you compare it side by side with the original one, it has mutations and those mutations largely have made it adapt to growing in the chicken instead of the human, which has an attenuating property. So, you know, it's the I I don't know if that's really a way to accomplish what Young Ling was suggesting or not to but uh uh let the virus do the work and evolve to a different host."
2021_10_01_MZT_S8,Claudia Herrera,739.0,"I think that we have to be carefully with with that kind of of compounds. We can generate autoimmunity, uh, you know, immune autoimmune response in in the host. Uh, no, a little we are boosting boosting the the with with different uh components that you know, the immune system can be crazy in in in in in in a specific time. So I think this is something that we need to be careful thinking in in to have an a general vaccine."
2021_10_01_MZT_S8,Curt Horvath,795.0,"All right, now with the diseases you're talking about, even 10% alleviation with the vaccine would would be a good thing, right? So we have to start somewhere."
2021_10_01_MZT_S8,Christoph Thaiss,861.0,"Yeah, I can I can access the Google Drive. I just don't find the file where"
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Ana Bento,818.0,"Yeah, I I agree with that. I think that uh it it comes from a concerted like um effort on kind of more diverse surveillance in the wild plus uh next generation sequencing. And I I really like the idea of kind of tolerance versus some sort of like immune response. Uh so in my PhD I did a lot of that with so sheep which are, you know, a wild animal where we're really trying to understand if there were some sort of like environmental cues uh that perhaps would push that spectrum from tolerance all the way to to disease type immune response. Uh and how that might actually change over time depending on uh how well um fed they are if if it was a particularly bad year um or if it's really just a kind of like a coevolution of the parasite and the host that allows them to tolerate but in the event of a of a stochastic jump that just kind of goes awry. Um but I I do agree that uh the sampling is is key uh but the sampling alone does not do it. It it definitely needs to have some sort of like field lab concerted kind of feedback loop collaboration um that makes sense to me. So I know there's a lot of people particularly in Colorado doing trying to do that uh with bats and other and ungulate species. Um so kind of really trying to understand precisely what Justin was highlighting which I do think it's it's key."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Justin Bahl,601.0,"when you get like um H5 getting into chickens, you have very low levels of of diversity. Uh even it gets into chickens, you may get a handful of viruses that get into chickens, uh and then potentially getting into humans, but they the diversity is lower every time it jumps into other hosts. So that's how I view a reservoir. That that's the that the diversity of of uh pathogens uh within a single within a single group uh of pathogens would be much higher. Now, if we're doing a community surveillance like this, you might that might be a good way to distinguish between in a wild animal, what is uh what is a reservoir uh what is a what pathogen is it a reservoir for and potentially what is causing a disease in that host."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Justin Bahl,1062.0,"Yeah, vector born pathogens really really challenge my brain. Um you know, you have the viral particle and then you have an infected vector and then you have another host. So the virus has to be competent to replicate in all these different cell types that are very divergent."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Efrem Lim,826.0,"Yeah, I agree with Rebecca that it's not practical or feasible to say I want to sequence every wildlife out there and catalog everything. I think it's not feasible. Um one of the things that I've been thinking a lot is about I'm not I'm not anywhere close to being expert, but there's this idea of a string theory where there's a lot of data points, but you don't have to understand all the data points, you don't have to actually go sample all the data points. There are certain key parts along that network and that's sufficient to infer then downstream events."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Efrem Lim,983.0,"In a alternate approach, it is that people who are not infected are as equally informative as people who are infected. And in which case there's some sort of system that then you report, hey, I'm not infected and that tells you, okay, in this cluster, there is low or no infection and then you sort of then fill in the gaps. So a negative data is actually helpful in in filling up this problem of infection and disease rather than the contact tracing approach which is solely based on information of who's positive. And I that's the kind of thing that makes me feel think that when you have a end problem of like a lot of species are being infected with different pathogens rather than sequencing every single one, you know, something like that some reverse approach may be more effective."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Rebecca Garabed,907.0,virus is on nematodes.
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Justin Bahl,914.0,Well.
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Justin Bahl,866.0,Is it.
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Rebecca Garabed,647.0,Sorry Giselle real quick.
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Sara Zimmer,972.0,"What the best reservoir to check would be and um whether the homogeneity of the reservoirs in the host should matter. Um and um we also brought up the fact that we can find these markers, but if they're in markers populations of reservoirs that never have contact with human and livestock, does it matter. So where as well as what gets samples is going to be very, very important. Um what do we do if we find something uh is has been brought up a lot. Again that relates to what does this ability to identify a predictive marker get us and we think we need to answer that. So is the science or the policy more important here. And then also, you know, maybe looking more at that step two, when we find a marker, you know, under understanding whether um these there's there's an inherent fitness or disadvantage or disadvantage when it comes to adaptation and spread is also going to be crucial and um how would we model the likelihood of this is another outstanding question. So just a lot of questions that we have that we feel we should focus on."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Chuck Lewis,838.0,"Yeah, I'm back."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Maria Fernandez,972.0,"And and think that it's not often discussed is like once the host is infected, let's say human, uh what do they do with that? So the probability of recovering from that infection. Uh let's say uh seek health care and getting even diagnosed. Um so it plays into actually different routes. It's not just susceptibility. And and there's also uh one of the things that I I in the systems that I work at least, there are feedbacks and tradeoffs that are not that linear."
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Sara Zimmer,1081.0,"Um and is a huge issue because we're all striving for prevention, um, but how do you know that you prevented something?"
2021_10_01_MZT_S4,Bethany McGregor,650.0,"Yep, I will be doing this. So uh Brenda took the notes and I'll be doing the report out and this is kind of a great segue from the previous conversation on spillover."
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,A Ali Yanik,898.0,Hi Ali.
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,A Ali Yanik,951.0,Ha.
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Lauren Charles,642.0,"And combining them with um say an AI ML approach um to to be able to incorporate as many factors as possible um and different things like that. Um very interested in one health and how can we combine um you know, humans, animals, plants and the environment um to better understand where disease is and have better situational awareness and help with um disease mitigation and um other things like that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Audrey Ruple,1060.0,Yes.
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Gonzalo Vazquez Prokopec,685.0,"So sorry, just to add to that, um, I remember having some exercises at some point looking at pandemic threats and and and we had issues on on Rift Valley fever as a potential uh threat to the US and at the same time we had the issue of how are we going to be looking at something that will be will be moving in cattle and we don't know how cattle move in the US because there is a siloed source of data for which we cannot access, right? And and in these you know high level discussions it almost felt like it was a barrier more than a great idea. Uh and I think you know that's crucial because you know zonatic pathogen, especially if you are looking now at agricultural pathogens too and vector borne, you really have to have not only the public health surveillance which is in a way uh improving but also how do we link these two bubbles. And I and I believe that there is core interest in both public health and and and you know agricultural health of why we should need to integrate data sources, you know?"
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Sen Pei,770.0,"It's all right. I mean I I think you know from a perspective modeling work, I think it's very important to have data on the exposure history which related to how how the animal move around and how people interact with those animals. And and oftentimes we don't have those data in the same place. Maybe we have human movement data uh to study human diseases. We may have some um animal movement data uh to study like uh animal diseases, but I I think sometimes we don't have the combined exposure history or likelihood of that. And uh, you know, I we have done some works uh on uh antimicrobial resistant pathogens in hospital settings."
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Sen Pei,854.0,Um
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Christine K Johnson,840.0,"Yeah, 100%. So what do you want to get out of your surveillance system? Or do you want to have?"
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Peter Dorhout,968.0,"Um and that are endogenous to a a what I would call a normal system, right? A healthy um environmental system. Because if we if we know all of that and there's and and then something new is introduced, we don't know where from or or what it is, but if there's a new protein or new um piece of of DNA or RNA that's introduced into a system about which we know everything else, that could be a sentinel indicator of you know, something new is in the environment. And so the the question is, how much do we know about everything in a healthy system."
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,A Ali Yanik,1088.0,"Uh one particular thing uh is to look at the waste water, right? Uh you can you can do check uh viral load, community viral load. Uh and then maybe if something is actually looking you know, suspicious, maybe that region can be investigated in more detail. Uh the other thing is that my wife is a veterinarian, um and I I talk these issues quite often with her. We never let our pets outside. Uh we are very sensitive about it. They get into bed with us so uh we better watch that. But uh, you know, uh she I mean"
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Lauren Charles,1148.0,Exactly.
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Kim Pepin,633.0,"Yeah, personally I feel like we need to move towards more mechanistic underpinnings in these models, in these risk assessment models that predict like where we expect to find antibodies, cases, wherever it is. I think we need to move towards you know, we have in some areas we have like real detailed sampling and those areas can really help us build these models that can then make the first hand predictions that we then go out and act on to collect more information and learn from. So I feel like we haven't done a great job at focusing in on like real detailed studies and trying to upscale that to link it to these other scales we're interested in like the global mapping."
2021_10_01_MZT_S9,Bethany McGregor,1016.0,"Yeah, if you just go looking for them, you're going to have a bad time."
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Jenny Maloney,940.0,So just in the note taking I just want so the point I mean the point that maybe the big point here being like in terms of surveillance thinking about what are the kinds of surveillance we might most be might be the most important um sort of animals or um environmental samples to be focused on is that kind of where you were going with
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Paola Boggiatto,1000.0,Yes.
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Paola Boggiatto,1055.0,"Yeah, sorry, I didn't I didn't mean to interrupt you. So, um, well, two things because after you finished what you're saying that got me thinking about something else. But, um, so I I'm currently working on a sensor that is an implantable sensor that would measure say interfering gamma, right? So interfering gamma, I mean that could be anything, right? Could be viral, could be parasitic, could be bacterial. Um, but maybe we we switch it over, right? We make it, okay, it's going to be type one interference. So, you know, you you put this under the skin of an animal and when that animal gets a viral infection, you don't know what that infection is, uh, that sensor is capable of detecting circulating type one interferon alpha, let's say. And it triggers a change in that receptor, sends a radio frequency signal that can be read from an, you know, from an RF reader say at a water tank. Um, you know, inside a dairy at the milking parlor, right? And it tells you that that animal isn't like something is going on with that animal, right? And it may not tell you what it is, but it tells you that something is wrong with that animal. And again, you can you can um utilize that information with a bunch of other things, right? As I was mentioning before, you know, motion sensor activity, temperature as was being suggested earlier, right? You can have all these things that are feeding, they're sort of feeding the system. Um, and and yeah, sure. I I think the answer is, yeah, I think the technology is there, we we could do that."
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Jenny Maloney,943.0,"Yes. Okay, so"
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Jenny Maloney,1001.0,Um.
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Jenny Maloney,962.0,So.
2021_09_30_MZT_S4,Paola Boggiatto,900.0,Who's going to pay for it.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Tavis Anderson,738.0,"Thanks, Hannah."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Crystal Hepp,1024.0,Um.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Kim Pepin,1153.0,Yeah.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Justin Bahl,683.0,"Right? rather than so if we think about like adaptation uh a bunch of viruses or a bunch of variants get into uh into a human and then only one of those variants are actually going to be able to replicate there. So you have uh evolutionary pressure actually and immune selection reducing that diversity rather than uh it tells us what comes afterwards. It's not necessarily telling us what is going what is happening with that that jump. Uh but from the genome sequencing, if we could do deep sequencing within a within the reservoir host and compare it to the sync host, then that might just tell us, hey, there has been selection there. I'm thinking as I speak sort of sort of lost the track train of thought as I started up there."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Tavis Anderson,567.0,"And then there's also the order and timing of how these things happen. So if you get infected by something at point A, what happens at point B if you're challenged by a subtly different pathogen. So when we think about the swine respiratory disease complex and this was a Justin point, this enormous cloud not just of influenza, but of RSV, of other viruses and then bacterial infections. So the secondary bacterial infections that they may may then take off antibiotic resistance stuff. And how can we then think about those transient dynamics and rare events and model those. So that was mostly me just rambling about the things that I'm thinking about trying to get out get out that bigger idea of how can we minimize the cloud of variance and if we minimize that cloud of variance, we might minimize the probability of spillover and emergence. And it could be done by thinking about the immune response within an individual host and how that impacts within host evolution and then between host evolution. And we may not need to have really highly parameterized models. We could just say this host has an immune response to this pathogen and then what happens subsequently. And then you could run evolutionary models on that or or network based models or landscape based models as well potentially. So that's my two two cents there."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Sara Zimmer,1078.0,"Um what I am hearing a lot of is a lot of um a talk about selection and it's coming from the lens of looking at genetics genetics and and genomics. Um which is what we have right now, which was what we can use. Um but the fact is I'm I'm just wondering if in fact um we are losing some information about the inherent the inherent um fitness flexibility of organisms by um really not taking any laboratory understanding of what those things mean um into consideration. So what I'm wondering is if it's possible to develop um some sort of I I guess um uh some some sort of modeling based on some tests that we might be able to do in the laboratory about how flexible organisms are in terms of their metabolism, how flexible organisms are in terms of their ability to withstand various things that a system could throw at them in terms of immune response and."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Linda Detwiler,641.0,"Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Oh, whoever, Salvador, you go ahead because yeah, Cheryl pointed first, yeah."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Justin Bahl,852.0,I I agree.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Linda Detwiler,834.0,I have another thing that happens in the preon or at least we do think it happens where plants uptake the pathogen and it's dispersed that way.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Hannah Frank,861.0,Let's just say preons are terrifying.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Linda Detwiler,907.0,Bye.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Daniel Becker,991.0,Um and also some new work on migration and disease in um temperate bats and temperate songbirds. So.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Bethany McGregor,1044.0,Frequently and depending on the vector some of them can move.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Gonzalo Vazquez Prokopec,567.0,"is just a trait, but when you couple that with other traits like infectiousness, behavior, that's where the real sweet deal of exposure and emergence is and we uh we develop a couple conceptual and mathematical frameworks to incorporate mobility at a second order level, which is coupled with other heterogeneities. And great great talk. I I have to jump out because I I have class but I have TAs. I have to go in and out to check in but um I'm in."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Kezia Manlove,624.0,"Yeah, and I think that's a place where you know, like contact in particular, I think fundamentally diverges in some sense from what Guillaume was saying about, you know, depending on how resources defined, I suppose, but as as movement is being fundamentally responsive to resources, which is true if you're thinking maybe about densities, but maybe not true if you're thinking about direct interaction, which is perhaps more um more dependent upon social forces or you know, yeah, interspecific interactions. So I wonder if it's possible that um that you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific times of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease. We might but I but I don't know."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Lauren Charles,669.0,"I mean, I think yeah, I think you know, just thinking about say a mechanistic model, right? If we had the ideal movement data, then you add in the disease on top of it, we could potentially more accurately understand what is going to happen actually happen when a disease gets introduced. Um, it will also help us understand control measures that could be used and put in place if we, you know, see hot areas of where um, you know, there's a lot of interface between humans and animals or the high risk animals, um, I think that would be important as well as um say understanding I think we would also need to know um have some sort of surveillance and understanding of what the disease is the the relative amount in those populations um in addition to, you know, the normal disease parameters."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Avery Strait,862.0,"And I guess my I guess the way I look at it is you have this data about the human, this data about the animals and then you're seeing what can we get of it. I guess I think of it from the end, we have this data and then if something happens, we're going to be able to use that data in a backwards like a trace back kind of fashion and say where did this occur. So you don't necessarily start here and go here, but you're working backward and I think that data that you have will become more relevant over time as long as you're collecting at enough data points and enough information to help you with that trace back because a lot of the time like when when I do animal disease investigations, I'm like, okay, where did this animal go? Of course, they're all supposed to be officially identified with RFID tags, so they're supposed to be traceable. Um, and that's that's just the kind of way we approach it."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Mark Wilber,927.0,"Oh, go ahead, Mark."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Liliana Salvador,1010.0,"Yeah, I think that that is a very good point because sometimes um so before I used to work with animal movement data, but now I only work with um with pretty much like density data. And and I don't really other than my my really real interest for animal movement, I don't really need much like very detailed information about animal movement. I just need to know actually if I have a a huge density of these populations in an area or not. So I think you're you're you're bringing a very good point that um maybe our efforts um which which because colors are expensive, you know, tracking detailed animal movement is very expensive and maybe I don't know. are they really necessary from a disease point of view?"
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Mike Wimberly,567.0,"uh the complexities of a local disease transmission cycle. Um often, you know, the specific characteristics of that will not extrapolate to other areas, but I think there's a big potential for gaining a better understanding of important mechanisms that are, you know, that are often broadly more important beyond an individual system. The other thing I I kind of hear everyone kind of also sort of maybe almost using that as a reference point but stretching toward this idea, you know, toward the the fuzzier picture of you know, what types of data, what framework do we need for a you know, maybe something in the context of much larger scale, continental to global surveillance. And you know, I I kind of feel like what you're reaching for there is some level of abstraction. Because when you when you get up there, you're not going to be dealing with individual animals. You know, it's not going to be I think as we all recognize, it's not going to be feasible to track every single animal on the continent. But you know, what what is it that would be the most useful? You know, would it be, you know, just throwing out one example off the top of my head, is it, you know, much better uh, you know, detailed maps of key migration routes, being able to understand, you know, the timing of migration, how they might light up earlier or later in different years. Um, you know, when particular species might be moving, how those might be shifting from year to year. So, uh anyway, I I just wanted to try to um, you know, try to frame some of those ideas in terms of where I hear you all going. But uh, I'll kind of put it back to the the group now."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Liliana Salvador,636.0,Go go on.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Kezia Manlove,705.0,This is a world where we would get to collar livestock?
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Avery Strait,727.0,"Um, we can track you mean like if they have a big piece of land and like dairies, they'll have like multiple, multiple pens. And so they're in their up close pen, they're getting ready to calf out, they're going to be over here. Once they calf out, they're going to the calf is going to go into this pen and the animal is going to go into that pen. At very well regulated dairies, yes, they do have that information, um, and they do track it, but if they don't keep solid records, which is sometimes hard to find, um, you can't trace it within the farm."
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Lauren Charles,939.0,I.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Lauren Charles,753.0,Go ahead.
2021_09_30_MZT_S7,Lauren Charles,860.0,Um so what kind of species? The pathogen species or the sorry.
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Sara Zimmer,1122.0,"I think one part of the answer to your question, Mike, is um how many the like yes, you could test for all potential pathogens in all potential hosts, but the reality is certain hosts tend to be, you know, tend to be the reservoirs for certain types of pathogens. And do we have a good map of the aggregate species that tend to be in one area or you know, in one group of hosts or another group of hosts or could such a map help to start that conversation."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Sara Zimmer,659.0,or and then the larger.
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Crystal Hepp,819.0,"Even with the divert within the diversity of bats, the more closely related bat species are to each other the easier it is easier it is for them to transmit rabies across. Um so it might be one way to sort of um to sort of attack this idea of species diversity and geography."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Sara Zimmer,853.0,But if you were adding some assumptions about things that you don't have to worry about.
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Sara Zimmer,859.0,Um.
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Maria Fernandez,599.0,"data and I'm always for open data, but I do acknowledge that getting data from the field it's very expensive, it's cost a lot of time. So it's it's managing that it's a little bit more tricky and it's just not think about just yeah, let's just collect all the data and just model it. Um, but I think there's certainly many initiatives in that sense that it's about integrating different data sets, data uh different data streams and also working with the communities as you someone mentioned with the the people in the farms and and trying to do that. But also understanding that if we're asking people to submit and do work in for the good of science that they understand what they're getting back from that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Mark Wilber,1052.0,"Yeah, I think I think that's a great point and then I think that really makes me think about like indirect transmission when we kind of have the environment affecting pathogen persistence. Um, and that could have some pretty serious implications for both kind of like I guess we call it reservoir potential of a species in an area, but it's really that pathogen interaction with the environment that's determining whether the pathogen can persist. So"
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Paola Boggiatto,1030.0,"Oh, I I agree with what you're saying Pilar and I think it's what Sarah you were trying to say is yeah, you can have an immune profile for a viral infection, but that doesn't tell you, doesn't really tell you whether that animal's going to be able to clear or not, especially when you're talking about innate immune responses, right? So okay, there is a response, but then overall what happens afterwards, does that animal clear it or not? So I think having that functional phenotype that you can tie it back to, I think is would, you know, would be important."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Mark Wilber,650.0,"Was that crosswalks you said? Yeah. Yeah, okay. I like that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Crystal Hepp,695.0,"As far as the making accessible to other fields, I think also making accessible to citizen scientists."
2021_10_01_MZT_S7,Crystal Hepp,820.0,"within within an area or phylogenetic diversity. I guess those what it would be. Um, but then distance, like you'd have distances to agriculture, distances to the urban interface."
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Danae Schulz,649.0,"Um so that's our sort of medical or applied part of our research and then on the basic science side, we're doing genetic screens to try and identify factors that are important for turning on the insect stage invariant surface proteins. Oh, and let's see, um, Diego. No, you talk, Diego, you already talked."
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Jenny Maloney,1031.0,"I mean, to me, is this a question about what makes something host specific and what allows for a parasite to be zoonotic? Is it is that the goal of the this question or is this something else?"
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Maria Fernandez,1141.0,Yeah.
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Claudia Herrera,1141.0,No.
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Maria Fernandez,834.0,"So you can and one of my interest is trying to identify those areas that are at high risk where I think that's where should be surveillance should be happening and find strategies there. I'm not saying like completely ignore what's happening in the wild, but have a more informed approach on how we do the surveillance and what we're like having very specific objectives of how we're going to look for this markers, how we're going to characterize the parasite populations or even the interactions between different parasites because coinfection we know that it's it's super important in this well at least in in some of this parasites and there's more and more evidence on that."
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,William Witola,967.0,"Of course, identifying the marker is one thing, then defining what that marker does to help the parasite infect the host is the next part. Then finally, trying to figure out how the host will counteract that marker to stop the parasite infecting."
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Sara Zimmer,962.0,"Okay, so"
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Sara Zimmer,979.0,widespread fire.
2021_10_01_MZT_S1,Silvie Huijben,947.0,"All right, thank you."
