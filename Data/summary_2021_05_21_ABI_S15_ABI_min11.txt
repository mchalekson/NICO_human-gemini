Final Solution-Oriented Summary:
====================================================================================================
[Chunk 1] Brad Smith: Maybe focus on your modality because I think when you get that's where we're going to be. Aniruddha Ray: I'm a chemistry based person and optical imaging is primarily what I do. Alexandra Dickinson: I am a developmental biologist who works in plants.

[Chunk 2] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: We've barely just gotten back to light sheet after 100 year hiatus. I think there's still an enormous amount of work to do on uh deep imaging with light sheet. Once you get the machines or the scopes, you know, as a commodity in most labs, that's that that really has impactful.

[Chunk 3] The more the more colors you can see and the redder the colors you are, this is going to help or are we pretty happy with the genetic reporters that you've got now? I mean, Sixian You: No.

[Chunk 4] Carolyn Bayer: We use ICG. because it's very concentrated and has sort of spectral properties that are that are easy to detect using a photoacoustic imaging. Barbara Smith: I want to help Jazz out a little bit because she's the only one in the whole conference I think doing plants.

[Chunk 5] Brad Smith: I've wondered there's people often want to have optical sensors sometimes for like pollution in the soil or the water. I sometimes wonder if plants because they draw stuff up could be an interesting way to report back current environmental conditions. Alexandra Dickinson: One way people use plants is is like for phytoremediation.

[Chunk 6] Aniruddha Ray: So actually someone else hijacked our room. Brad Smith: Okay, now we're pirates. that's quite interesting that we've gone in and we'll occupy their slide until they pay us some money or something.

[Chunk 7] The only way the most basic way that they know that they've hit a cell of interest is by creating a connection between that electrode and that cell. You don't know what cell you're hitting until you start recording it. And if you've started recording the wrong cell, you have to remove that micropipette electrode, place a new one in and then enter into the brain one more time.

Interpretation Notes:
====================================================================================================
Idea Convergence Indicators:
- Multidisciplinary domains referenced (optical, plants, brain, sensing)
- Collaboration and back-and-forth building (e.g., plants â†’ phytoremediation)
- Shift from problem framing to actionable techniques (contrast agents, sensors)
- Psychological safety signals (e.g., playful tone, room hijacking)

Follow-Up Ideas:
- Trace evolution of cross-modality ideas in later minutes
- Compare with low-convergence windows
- Check Gemini codes for "explanation" and "decision" alignment

Cohesive Synthesis Output:
====================================================================================================
The conference was organized by the Optical Imaging Society of America.
