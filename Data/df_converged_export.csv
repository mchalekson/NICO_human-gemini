0,Idea_2,827.0,Hannah Frank,"I go out, I catch bats, I take their saliva and then I do these PCRs for various infections. Um trying to understand what's out there. And something that I always think about is like I can get, you know, data on the infections, I can get data on, you know, immune parameters and stuff and but like what does that tell us? Like if you have a highly defended host or like, you know, they have high white blood cells, does that mean that they're sick? Does that mean that they are like ready to go or even if you look at it like from at evolutionary lineages, if something we can infer it's been under strong pathogen driven selection, does that make it any more or less likely to be a reservoir for infections? Does that mean like, oh, it's been under the strong pressure or maybe it's like really equipped and it pretty healthy. So I and with all this viral screening data and sort of data about hosts, what does that actually mean for spillover? So that first prompt might have been from one of my pre conference surveys.",other,False,True

0,Idea_3,897.0,Kim Pepin,"from a modeler's perspective, you know, like what surveillance data could we collect that would inform the drivers, you know? So I feel like, you know, traditionally we work a lot with just like PCR case data, you know? So that is like what most of epidemiological theory is built on is just case data and now with all the emerging technologies out there with, you know, these kind of immunity parameters, you, you know, how can we put all that stuff together to, you know, best inform spillover.",other,True,False
0,Idea_3,572.0,adela,"Yeah, for me at least of spillover is also the one that contains the like the the first source, the animal zero, you know, because that's the one that passed it on to animal one and then pass it pass it to humans, right? Uh, so I think both of them are part of the of the risk of that spillover and they both are going to uh represent different pressures, right? Because you would think that the first animal that normally gets infected, let's say like a bat, uh, they have a different immune response than a pig. So like what Justin was saying, because of that immune pressure, they are going to be different variants of the virus and that's why you see changes on the epito, right? You you you change you see changes in epito and you change see changes in receptor and that's when they then become able to infect humans. Like this is very well known like in influenza. In influenza the the influenza virus has the the per influenza has to pass through pigs in order to be able to infect humans. So we do know that there are pressures. We just don't know like to what extent these pressures uh are necessary for the for these pathogens to then spill over to humans.",other,False,True
0,Idea_13,567.0,Kim Pepin,"the different within host immune factors and what they mean in terms of traits. So, you know, we know and I mean like epidemiological or evolutionary traits of a pathogen. So if we think about the epidemiology side, we know that, you know, high host growth rates, you know, can lead to more transmission and therefore more viral replication and more genetic diversity. Um, and then we have this other side of things which is these immune factors that, you know, might cause bad physiological conditions in the host. So worse replication for the virus, not as much genetic diversity. And then we have these other situations where you get a high immune response and so there's like a strong immunity pressure, strong selection. So these kinds of I I thought about these questions like way back during my PhD with is there can we predict evolution based on environmental conditions. So if you have a situation that, you know, the pathogen can't propagate in very well, but a hard selection pressure, are there fewer ways to adapt in that context than if you're able to replicate to high rates, um, and maybe selection is weak. Um, so I just started thinking, you know, more recently I've been working in the world of epidemiology and thinking about all of the ecological processes and then folks who keep on the um evolutionary side, I still feel like these fields are a little bit siloed and our techniques, you know, the file dynamics have really been trying to bring in the demographics into um inference about evolution. But there's so much more to do, like we're still not really bringing in like the um environmental conditions and these different selection pressures that are in the environment as well as we could, you know, because like when we want when we want to go about predicting, you know, out there, where should we look for or where where is the high risk for an emerging disease, we got to be able to link these environmental conditions to this these evolutionary processes and I feel like that's kind of what we're missing. So I really I think what Hannah suggested in trying to understand, you know, what host immune factors should we be looking for. If we can be able to correlate those host immune factors to different within host conditions that affect the virus evolution, it seems like that's a good sort of avenue of questioning. Um, and I was thinking like it would be nice to sort of like list very broadly because I'm not an immunologist, but I've tried to dabble in like immunologist data and I'm like this is so confusing. Um, but like if an immunologist could tell me like, oh, when I get this reading, essentially that means the immune system is primed and there's like strong selection on the virus. Um, versus like when I get this reading, the host is super stressed out, it's not good conditions for viral replication. You know, then we could have these real basic traits that we could be putting in epidemiological models that are directly correlated to effects on viral evolution.",other,True,False
0,Idea_13,778.0,Linda Detwiler,"Thank you. You know, Salvador had his hand up.",other,False,False
0,Idea_13,782.0,Salvador Almagro,"Yeah, because I I think it's really nice that uh basically what Kim just mentioned and what Sarah mentioned, it's kind of like I I wanted to bring both of them within what the context of a understanding, you know, the the the ecological drivers, but also this kind of like um, you know, dark matter of of what it takes to be a pathogen and we understand that immune evasion is you know, the bread and butter of how to kill a human. But there's the more we know, the the clearer that this is just, you know, one of the millions hurdles that these organisms have to. So I think like looking at it from a holistic perspective on both sides, right? You know, a the the most random factor in the environment might be actually selecting for some traits that we don't really know have a major advantage in in colonizing the host. Again, we know that if you can, you know, avoid getting, you know, immune cells to detect you, that's a that's a wonderful thing if you want to kill us. But how about, you know, Sarah mentioned metabolic processes. Uh, how about the ability to use some some um, some nutrients and out compete things like the microbiota because you know, these guys if you want to colonize the gut, there's been somebody living there way longer than you. So you you have to take care of that as well. So there's like um, so this kind of juncture, right? juncture of what do you need to become a pathogen and what is giving you those traits in in the environment, you know, the training ground basically. So I I think that you know that kind of I it was useful that uh Kim mentioned that right after Sarah. So I think those two are one and the same, right? Uh two sides of the same coin.",other,False,False

Um and so if you think about your like your your simplest situation where you have individuals just sort of moving randomly in some area, we have a very predictable contact pattern that emerges from that. Um but we sort of we sort of realize that in some cases that's not how animals are actually moving.

So I wonder if it's possible that um that you know, just just the the mechanisms that underpin specific kinds of interactions that are say or specific times of kinds of movement that are salient to disease should be it might be useful to focus more on those as opposed to like movement writ large, you know, because I'm not sure if we need all of movement to understand the salient portions for disease.

We take these hosts, we don't, you know, like when I work on megafauna, right? So we catch an animal, we get one cross-sectional sample, we can we're not calibrated to forecast disease dynamics well or or internal state well within the animal. And so we don't know how susceptibility is varying.

Maybe they're farms um or ponds or something that's very discrete where you can say, well, we have something happening within these within this farm. Um but then we might not necessarily know what's happening within that farm or maybe we don't care all that much about finding the details what's happening within that farm. But understanding the connectivity between those nodes is something that would be slightly more feasible. Um both from obviously from a farm standpoint that's very feasible because you know what cows moving from farm A to farm B. But then also in wildlife if you if you have a population that's structured like that more of a kind of standard meta population. Um you can use, you know, potentially genetic tools where you only need to sample a few individuals to understand something about connectivity between those nodes. But that begins I think to break down when you don't have that like nice partitioning, which in a lot of wildlife systems you don't. So then I'm then I think that scale becomes harder to bridge.
