917.0,Sixian You,"Hi everyone. My name is Sishan Yo. Uh, I recently started in electric engineering department at MIT. My background is in optics and microscopy. Uh, so, uh, we are very much troubled by deep tissue imaging because uh, we're we're blessed with this submicro resolution but we can rarely go deeper than millimeter uh depth. So what my lab does, uh, we want to tackle this issue and also a lot of other like imaging speed or contrast issue from three aspects. The first aspect is uh, um multiphoton imaging.","{'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker is introducing themself and their background in optics and microscopy, providing context for their subsequent statements about deep tissue imaging.', 'present new idea': 'The speaker introduces the idea that their lab wants to tackle the deep tissue imaging issue, along with imaging speed and contrast issues, from three aspects, which is a new approach being presented.', 'expand on existing idea': 'The speaker mentions multiphoton imaging as the first aspect of their approach to tackle deep tissue imaging, building upon the previously mentioned problem of deep tissue imaging.'}",0
