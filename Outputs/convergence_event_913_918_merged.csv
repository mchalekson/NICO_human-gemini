2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",935.0,Barbara Smith,proposal,we can,"So what do we do in my lab? We're using um we're using actually clinically and clinical and research tools um to translate light and sound. And so we use electrodes as our wave guides to um to send light down, uh target a molecule of interest in the in the deep tissue um that uh might have a some genetic marker. And then um we we can get both sound wave and light wave back up the electrode."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",990.0,Aniruddha Ray,reopen,But,But it's definitely possible. But then again with photoacoustics your resolution is not as good as optical purely optical methods.
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1006.0,Barbara Smith,affirm,we'll,"And so we uh we develop um integrated systems for like pipels uh so for endometrial cancer for instance that um right now they go in blind and um an OBGYN will take out cells um in in throughout the uterus, but it's just a vacuum system that they'll place in and they'll um release a vacuum and then that tube will be removed manually. And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so um how we um re I I would say um reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding area so we can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds. So they're doing acoustic information anyways. Um so we've we've integrated tools into research and clinical."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1033.0,Brad Smith,affirm,Let's,Let's um I mean I think.
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1036.0,Brad Smith,reopen,go back,"We we could return back to this wave guide. We've got 15 minutes, so we we may have to go to our bullet points, but I was anybody had any points that they wrote down or thought about that that they'd like to move this discussion in a to raise now or we can go back to Barbara's wave guide technology which was getting a lot of interest here."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1049.0,Carolyn Bayer,affirm,we should,"Um, you know, I do photoacoustics which is using um optics to excite to then ultrasound acoustics to receive. Um, you know, is there some other excitation that we should be thinking about beyond light since we know the limitations of light or"
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1084.0,Carolyn Bayer,affirm,let's,"Okay, let's let's try millimeters first."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1086.0,Carolyn Bayer,proposal,How about,Or or half a centimeter. How about half a centimeter?
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1097.0,Carolyn Bayer,proposal,we can,"Um that said we still have depth limitations. You know, we're limited to to two to three centimeters. I would say. Um, but we still want to go deeper than that even obviously so that we can image clinically."
