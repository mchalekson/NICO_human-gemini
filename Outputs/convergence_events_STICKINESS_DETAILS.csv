0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",690.0,Aniruddha Ray,proposal,we can,"Sure, I can start to summarize and we can conclude this discussion."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",692.0,Barbara Smith,proposal,we can,"Yeah, so we do it's electrophysiology. So um the micropipette electrode um was developed I think it's around the 1960s and um they record neuronal activity. It's a high resolution recording of typically single neurons um and their activity level um with the with the um basically I won't go into detail. Um so the electrode is placed into the brain and um it's typically done either um blind or um using optical microscopy approaches from from external sources. So uh a microscope on the outside. And and so what ends up happening is if you have um if you work with this blind, you would use like probably a DIC microscope and um you can do this in vivo and the electrode is placed in and uh positive pressure is is pushed into the electrode as it's moved through the brain tissue so that that electrode doesn't get clogged. The tip of the electrode is about um one to three microns in diameter and that electrode is is moved little very very very slowly into the brain um and there's no way to target selective cells of interest using the blind approach, but you can get deeper, right? So um the only way the most basic way that they know that they've hit a cell of interest is by creating a connection between that electrode and that cell. So they place it from a positive pressure and then we make a negative pressure from that. We create a bleb, so it sucks up part of that membrane of the cell. Um we um increase the pressure and it opens up the cell membrane so that there's a direct connection between that electrode and the fluids within the electrode and the cell um solution. And and what ends up happening is the um it ends up being able to record that cell, but you don't know what cell you're hitting until you start recording it. And if you've started recording the wrong cell, you have to remove that micropipette electrode um throw it out, place a new one in and then enter into the brain one more time. And so uh it's kind of a hunt and peck process. You can get deeper and people can record very well uh neuroscientists have been recording like that for for decades. Um but lately with two photon microscopy, you can get down to about a millimeter and you can genetically alter or place in different kinds of dyes and and selectively target neurons up to a millimeter. But past the millimeter from the cortical surface, um there are minimal ways to do it. So you can suction out a portion of the brain. Um that's one way to do it and then the animal is still alive and you can move down um and you can do within a millimeter of whatever area you've sectioned. Um or if you're coming from the top, you can see cells about within a millimeter of of where that surface is. If you're exceptional if you're doing three photon or multi photon, you can get maybe two millimeters. Um it's a little bit rough. Um but the way that we're doing this is oh oh is we're integrating light and sound into that micropipette electrode so you don't need a microscope on the outside to guide that cell. And so um we can get uh stains and genetic um uh genetic contrast throughout the brain and now we can we can tap into cells um of interest at at depths beyond one millimeter as deep as that. So we're combining um blind and an imaging guided approach by doing this, but without the microscope on the outside. Hope that made sense."

0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",714.0,Carolyn Bayer,proposal,we can,"Yeah, so we use ICG, you know, um, so we're typically imaging in the near infrared, um, far near infrared if we can get those dyes. Um, and you know, I'll often talk to people who are developing fluorescent probes who have failures that aren't fluorescent. You know, so those are the ones that we can image well."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",720.0,Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy,reopen,But,"But but beyond light sheet, I mean, we've barely just gotten back to light sheet after 100 year hiatus. I think there's still an enormous amount of work to do on uh deep imaging with light sheet."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",722.0,Brad Smith,affirm,we should,"Okay, now we're pirates. that's quite interesting that we've gone in and we should do ransomware and we'll occupy their slide until they pay us some money or something."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",743.0,Aniruddha Ray,proposal,we can,I guess we can do 3.4 then.
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",750.0,Brad Smith,affirm,we'll,"Well, we'll just become 3.4B or something like this. So what you're on slide, which one? 54."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",776.0,Carolyn Bayer,reopen,But,"But I think um that I mean, obviously the other thing that absorbs light strongly is nano particles. Um so there's been a lot of people in photoacoustics that have used metallic nano particles which have surface plasma resonance that absorb it."

0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",895.0,Aniruddha Ray,reopen,But,But I'm in four and also in seven though.
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",895.0,Brad Smith,affirm,we'll,"Um, if you want to just generate a word document or something and all we need is four bullet points at at the end, we'll work on that a little bit more."
0,679.7,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",917.0,Sixian You,proposal,we can,"Hi everyone. My name is Sishan Yo. Uh, I recently started in electric engineering department at MIT. My background is in optics and microscopy. Uh, so, uh, we are very much troubled by deep tissue imaging because uh, we're we're blessed with this submicro resolution but we can rarely go deeper than millimeter uh depth. So what my lab does, uh, we want to tackle this issue and also a lot of other like imaging speed or contrast issue from three aspects. The first aspect is uh, um multiphoton imaging."

2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",935.0,Barbara Smith,proposal,we can,"So what do we do in my lab? We're using um we're using actually clinically and clinical and research tools um to translate light and sound. And so we use electrodes as our wave guides to um to send light down, uh target a molecule of interest in the in the deep tissue um that uh might have a some genetic marker. And then um we we can get both sound wave and light wave back up the electrode."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",990.0,Aniruddha Ray,reopen,But,But it's definitely possible. But then again with photoacoustics your resolution is not as good as optical purely optical methods.
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1006.0,Barbara Smith,affirm,we'll,"And so we uh we develop um integrated systems for like pipels uh so for endometrial cancer for instance that um right now they go in blind and um an OBGYN will take out cells um in in throughout the uterus, but it's just a vacuum system that they'll place in and they'll um release a vacuum and then that tube will be removed manually. And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so um how we um re I I would say um reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding area so we can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds. So they're doing acoustic information anyways. Um so we've we've integrated tools into research and clinical."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1033.0,Brad Smith,affirm,Let's,Let's um I mean I think.
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1036.0,Brad Smith,reopen,go back,"We we could return back to this wave guide. We've got 15 minutes, so we we may have to go to our bullet points, but I was anybody had any points that they wrote down or thought about that that they'd like to move this discussion in a to raise now or we can go back to Barbara's wave guide technology which was getting a lot of interest here."
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1049.0,Carolyn Bayer,affirm,we should,"Um, you know, I do photoacoustics which is using um optics to excite to then ultrasound acoustics to receive. Um, you know, is there some other excitation that we should be thinking about beyond light since we know the limitations of light or"
2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1084.0,Carolyn Bayer,affirm,let's,"Okay, let's let's try millimeters first."

2,913.0,"Blocks,Clauses,Sentence",1097.0,Carolyn Bayer,proposal,we can,"Um that said we still have depth limitations. You know, we're limited to to two to three centimeters. I would say. Um, but we still want to go deeper than that even obviously so that we can image clinically."
