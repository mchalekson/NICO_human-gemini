That's what I always ask when I meet people who do wave front shaping. | [1062.0s] Luke Mortensen: You guys can hear me? | [1065.0s] Sixian You: I can hear you. | [1070.0s] Carolyn Bayer: How do we get. | [1070.0s] Barbara Smith: Um | [1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: to five to six centimeters with your technique. | [1072.0s] Luke Mortensen: Um and um so I guess I'll continue. Um, and so we're working towards like trying to image into and through highly scattering bone um or other highly scattering tissues. Um, and doing that by moving towards like 1300, 1700 uh wavelength regime as well as doing um aberration correction and scattering correction to allow our point spread function to be um reconstructed deep in the tissue. | [1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: alternatively, I mean just to describe what how we get around the limitation in photoacoustic imaging is that | [1075.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Can we? | [1076.0s] Luke Mortensen: You mean millimeters or. | [1078.0s] Alexandra Dickinson: Oh. | [1079.0s] Brad Smith: Well, she said centimeters. | [1080.0s] Carolyn Bayer: we are not worried about coherent focus light, you know, we're using scattered light for our imaging purpose. | [1084.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Okay, let's let's try millimeters first. | [1086.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Or or half a centimeter. How about half a centimeter? | [1092.0s] Brad Smith: Well, does anybody want to just explain that in layman's terms wave front technology to the rest of the group. | [1096.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Right. | [1097.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Um that said we still have depth limitations. You know, we're limited to to two to three centimeters. I would say. Um, but we still want to go deeper than that even obviously so that we can image clinically. | [1099.0s] Brad Smith: It um it it always impresses me that you know, if you if you do get sick or you know, you get "
