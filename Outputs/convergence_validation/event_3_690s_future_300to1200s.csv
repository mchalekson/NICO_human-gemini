690.0,990.0,Aniruddha Ray,But it's definitely possible. But then again with photoacoustics your resolution is not as good as optical purely optical methods.,False,reopen
690.0,997.0,Sixian You,"And then the second aspect is how to use optics and algorithms to push it deeper. So instead of avoid uh multiple scattering photons just getting ballistic photons, how can we use multiple scattering? How can we use deterministic models of multiple scattering to get deeper into the tissue.",True,reopen
690.0,999.0,Aniruddha Ray,Yeah.,True,affirm

690.0,1002.0,Sixian You,"measurement is uh is an interesting approach to tackle deep tissue imaging because uh most fluorescence imaging are intensity dependent. So if you go deeper, it's actually not absolute, but lifetime is kind of absolute. So as long as you have enough photons, uh lifetime could be a robust way to go go forward, especially for some metabolic ratio metric imaging.",True,reopen
690.0,1006.0,Barbara Smith,"And so we uh we develop um integrated systems for like pipels uh so for endometrial cancer for instance that um right now they go in blind and um an OBGYN will take out cells um in in throughout the uterus, but it's just a vacuum system that they'll place in and they'll um release a vacuum and then that tube will be removed manually. And so we've integrated like an optical and acoustic system into that so that they can have visual guidance and eyes where they're currently going in blind. And so um how we um re I I would say um reposition the light as we go at a 90 degree angle, we'll we'll place an optical fiber in with um with some kind of redirection. And so we can get um both optics and acoustics coming from the surrounding area so we can look for different different things both endogenous, so like um that hemoglobin and and different kinds of areas where there's increased vasculature um and acoustic information as well and they're also doing transactional ultrasounds. So they're doing acoustic information anyways. Um so we've we've integrated tools into research and clinical.",True,reopen
690.0,1007.0,Carolyn Bayer,"I was kind of my question as I was listening is that um, are we only thinking about deep tissue imaging in the context of optics and it seems like it's a very, you know, optics microscopy heavy group, but um, obviously thinking about our colleagues that work in other imaging modalities like MRI.",True,reopen

690.0,1136.0,Sixian You,"Yes, so I was thinking about uh the just like a microendoscopy. So use uh fiber as the wave guide to transmit the images in. There are challenges about it is that uh how to preserve the images on the way in and on the way out.",True,affirm

690.0,1156.0,Carolyn Bayer,So we we so there's there's essentially two different strategies for photoacoustic imaging.

690.0,1167.0,Sixian You,"And so how to use ultrasound to push this deeper. Um photoacoustic is a perfect genius example of doing this.
