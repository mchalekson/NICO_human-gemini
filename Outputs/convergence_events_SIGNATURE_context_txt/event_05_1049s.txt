-------------------------------------------------
[1028.0s] Luke Mortensen: Sorry, change location. I use my computer. Okay, um, I'm uh assistant professor at University of Georgia. Um, and uh Athens Georgia, um biomedical engineering background. Um, and I um am primarily working with uh multiphoton imaging. Um, so two photon and you know, a bunch of towards three photon, you know, etc. And um, uh trying to um move as well both on the fluorescence side, um as well as in the second harmonic, third harmonic generation. | [{'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker is explaining the specific types of multiphoton imaging they work with, including two-photon, second harmonic, and third harmonic generation, which clarifies the scope of their work in the context of deep tissue imaging.'}]
[1033.0s] Brad Smith: Let's um I mean I think. | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad is encouraging participation by pausing and leaving the statement open-ended, inviting others to contribute to the discussion.'}
[1036.0s] Brad Smith: We we could return back to this wave guide. We've got 15 minutes, so we we may have to go to our bullet points, but I was anybody had any points that they wrote down or thought about that that they'd like to move this discussion in a to raise now or we can go back to Barbara's wave guide technology which was getting a lot of interest here. | [{'encourage particpatioin': "Brad Smith is encouraging participation by asking if anyone has points they'd like to raise, building on the previous discussion about deep tissue imaging techniques."}, {'propose decision': "Brad Smith proposes a decision to return to Barbara's waveguide technology discussion, which had previously garnered interest, as an alternative if no one has new points to raise."}]
[1038.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: I'm I'm looking at history, but I don't actually see the right version. | {'express frustration': 'Genia expresses frustration because she is looking at the history of the document but cannot find the correct version, which is needed to restore lost content.'}
[1045.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: That has stuff in it. | {'acknowledge contribution': 'Genia is acknowledging that the Google document has content, following a discussion about technical difficulties with the document.'}
[1049.0s] Brad Smith: I'm just a bit worried this is going to happen again here shortly. We're going to lose it again. It's um. | {'express frustration': 'Brad expresses worry that the text they are working on will be lost again, indicating frustration with the technical difficulties they are experiencing.'}
[1049.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Um, you know, I do photoacoustics which is using um optics to excite to then ultrasound acoustics to receive. Um, you know, is there some other excitation that we should be thinking about beyond light since we know the limitations of light or | {'explain or define term or concept': 'Carolyn explains photoacoustics as using optics to excite and ultrasound acoustics to receive.', 'present new idea': 'Carolyn presents the idea of considering other excitation methods beyond light, given the limitations of light for deep tissue imaging.'}
[1053.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Wavefront is also interesting. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Carolyn is adding to the discussion about techniques for deep tissue imaging, building on the previous discussion about wave guides and fiber optics by mentioning wavefront shaping as another interesting approach.'}
[1057.0s] Barbara Smith: There's a couple of people that do wave front shaping in here. | {'acknowledge contribution': 'Barbara acknowledges the expertise of other participants in the meeting by mentioning that some of them work on wavefront shaping, recognizing their potential contribution to the discussion.'}
[1060.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Yeah, that's what I was about to say. That's what I always ask when I meet people who do wave front shaping. | [{'acknowledge contribution': 'Carolyn acknowledges that she was about to bring up wavefront shaping, which someone else has already mentioned, recognizing their input.'}]
[1062.0s] Luke Mortensen: You guys can hear me? | {'ask clarifying question': 'Luke is checking if the other participants can hear him, which is a request for confirmation of audibility.'}
[1065.0s] Sixian You: I can hear you. | {'express agreement': 'Sixian confirms that he can hear Luke, indicating agreement that the audio connection is working.'}
[1070.0s] Carolyn Bayer: How do we get. | [{'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking a question, implying she wants to know how to achieve something, likely related to the deep tissue imaging discussion.'}]
[1070.0s] Barbara Smith: Um | {'None': 'This utterance is incomplete and does not express any specific idea, decision, or action.'}
[1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: to five to six centimeters with your technique. | {'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking a clarifying question about how to achieve a certain depth of imaging with a specific technique, building on the discussion about deep tissue imaging and different modalities.'}
[1072.0s] Luke Mortensen: Um and um so I guess I'll continue. Um, and so we're working towards like trying to image into and through highly scattering bone um or other highly scattering tissues. Um, and doing that by moving towards like 1300, 1700 uh wavelength regime as well as doing um aberration correction and scattering correction to allow our point spread function to be um reconstructed deep in the tissue. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Luke is building on the previous discussion about deep tissue imaging modalities by describing his work on imaging through highly scattering tissues like bone.', 'provide supporting evidence': 'Luke provides specific details about his approach, such as using 1300-1700 nm wavelengths and aberration/scattering correction, to support his work on imaging through highly scattering tissues.'}
[1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: alternatively, I mean just to describe what how we get around the limitation in photoacoustic imaging is that | {'explain or define term or concept': 'Carolyn is about to explain how they overcome limitations in photoacoustic imaging, which is a method she uses.', 'expand on existing idea': 'Carolyn is expanding on the discussion of deep tissue imaging limitations by offering an alternative approach using photoacoustic imaging.'}
