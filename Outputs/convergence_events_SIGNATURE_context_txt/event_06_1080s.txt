------------------------------------------
[1057.0s] Barbara Smith: There's a couple of people that do wave front shaping in here. | {'acknowledge contribution': 'Barbara acknowledges the expertise of other participants in the meeting by mentioning that some of them work on wavefront shaping, recognizing their potential contribution to the discussion.'}
[1060.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Yeah, that's what I was about to say. That's what I always ask when I meet people who do wave front shaping. | [{'acknowledge contribution': 'Carolyn acknowledges that she was about to bring up wavefront shaping, which someone else has already mentioned, recognizing their input.'}]
[1062.0s] Luke Mortensen: You guys can hear me? | {'ask clarifying question': 'Luke is checking if the other participants can hear him, which is a request for confirmation of audibility.'}
[1065.0s] Sixian You: I can hear you. | {'express agreement': 'Sixian confirms that he can hear Luke, indicating agreement that the audio connection is working.'}
[1070.0s] Carolyn Bayer: How do we get. | [{'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking a question, implying she wants to know how to achieve something, likely related to the deep tissue imaging discussion.'}]
[1070.0s] Barbara Smith: Um | {'None': 'This utterance is incomplete and does not express any specific idea, decision, or action.'}
[1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: to five to six centimeters with your technique. | {'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking a clarifying question about how to achieve a certain depth of imaging with a specific technique, building on the discussion about deep tissue imaging and different modalities.'}
[1072.0s] Luke Mortensen: Um and um so I guess I'll continue. Um, and so we're working towards like trying to image into and through highly scattering bone um or other highly scattering tissues. Um, and doing that by moving towards like 1300, 1700 uh wavelength regime as well as doing um aberration correction and scattering correction to allow our point spread function to be um reconstructed deep in the tissue. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Luke is building on the previous discussion about deep tissue imaging modalities by describing his work on imaging through highly scattering tissues like bone.', 'provide supporting evidence': 'Luke provides specific details about his approach, such as using 1300-1700 nm wavelengths and aberration/scattering correction, to support his work on imaging through highly scattering tissues.'}
[1072.0s] Carolyn Bayer: alternatively, I mean just to describe what how we get around the limitation in photoacoustic imaging is that | {'explain or define term or concept': 'Carolyn is about to explain how they overcome limitations in photoacoustic imaging, which is a method she uses.', 'expand on existing idea': 'Carolyn is expanding on the discussion of deep tissue imaging limitations by offering an alternative approach using photoacoustic imaging.'}
[1075.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Can we? | [{'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking a question to the wave front shaping experts about the possibility of reaching a certain depth with their technique, following up on the discussion about wave front shaping and its potential.'}]
[1076.0s] Luke Mortensen: You mean millimeters or. | {'ask clarifying question': 'Luke asks for clarification on the units Carolyn used, as she mentioned centimeters, which seems like a large depth for wavefront shaping techniques.'}
[1078.0s] Alexandra Dickinson: Oh. | [{'express humor': 'The speaker says "Oh" in response to a misunderstanding about the units of measurement (centimeters vs. millimeters), suggesting a humorous realization of the scale difference.'}]
[1079.0s] Brad Smith: Well, she said centimeters. | [{'acknowledge contribution': "Brad acknowledges Carolyn's previous statement about imaging depth in centimeters, showing he is listening to her contribution."}]
[1080.0s] Carolyn Bayer: we are not worried about coherent focus light, you know, we're using scattered light for our imaging purpose. | {'explain or define term or concept': 'Carolyn explains that in photoacoustic imaging, they use scattered light rather than coherent focused light, which helps them overcome the limitations of light-based imaging in deep tissues, as she mentioned the group seems to be optics microscopy heavy.'}
[1084.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Okay, let's let's try millimeters first. | {'propose decision': 'Carolyn proposes to focus on achieving millimeter-scale depth with wavefront shaping, acknowledging the ambitiousness of the initial goal of centimeters, which follows a discussion about the limitations of current deep tissue imaging techniques.'}
[1086.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Or or half a centimeter. How about half a centimeter? | {'ask clarifying question': 'Carolyn is asking for a more achievable depth for wavefront shaping, after initially asking about 5-6 centimeters, which was questioned by Luke.'}
[1092.0s] Brad Smith: Well, does anybody want to just explain that in layman's terms wave front technology to the rest of the group. | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad is trying to get someone to explain wavefront technology to the group, inviting someone else to contribute to the discussion.'}
[1096.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Right. | {'acknowledge contribution': "Carolyn is acknowledging Brad's statement, but not agreeing or expanding on it."}
[1097.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Um that said we still have depth limitations. You know, we're limited to to two to three centimeters. I would say. Um, but we still want to go deeper than that even obviously so that we can image clinically. | {'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker is defining the depth limitations of photoacoustic imaging, stating that they are limited to two to three centimeters.', 'express frustration': 'The speaker expresses frustration with the current depth limitations of photoacoustic imaging, indicating a desire to go deeper for clinical imaging.'}
[1099.0s] Brad Smith: It um it it always impresses me that you know, if you if you do get sick or you know, you get some sort of cancer like that, you | {'express enthusiasm': 'Brad expresses his admiration for the advancements in imaging technologies, particularly in the context of cancer diagnosis, showing his excitement for the potential impact of these technologies on healthcare.'}
[1102.0s] Sixian You: So wave front image uh engineering. | {'explain or define term or concept': "Sixian is beginning to explain the concept of wavefront engineering in response to Brad's request for a layman's explanation."}
