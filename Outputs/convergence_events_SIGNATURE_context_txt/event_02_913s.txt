[889.0s] Luke Mortensen: I mean, I just I can't think of very many or any any examples of that, but, you know, it's not my area of expertise, so. | {'acknowledge contribution': {'Explanation': "Luke acknowledges that he doesn't have examples for the idea he proposed, recognizing his limited expertise in that specific area."}}
[889.0s] Brad Smith: Maybe a second bullet point is uh photoacoustic imaging saves the day. | {'propose decision': {'Explanation': 'Brad suggests a specific point to include in the summary bullet points, which is a concrete choice for the group to consider.'}, 'express humor': {'Explanation': 'Brad makes a lighthearted statement suggesting photoacoustic imaging will solve the problems, which is intended as a joke.'}}
[895.0s] Brad Smith: Okay, so we're still sort of uh talking about beyond light sheet um is is light sheet just to finish that sort of is light sheet going to really change biomedical science? | [{'ask clarifying question': 'Brad is asking whether light sheet microscopy will significantly impact biomedical science, following a discussion about its current limitations and potential for improvement.'}]
[895.0s] Luke Mortensen: And um I think there's more opportunity because it's not it's not just reconstructing the PSF where you just have enough of a power density, you're also the pulse duration is becomes very important as well. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Luke is expanding on the previous discussion about multiphoton imaging and how to improve deep tissue imaging, adding that pulse duration is also important, not just power density and PSF reconstruction.'}
[895.0s] Carolyn Bayer: So it's primarily pre clinical right now. | {'explain or define term or concept': "Carolyn is clarifying that her work with photoacoustic imaging and preeclampsia is currently in the pre-clinical stage, meaning it's in the research phase before human trials."}

[895.0s] Aniruddha Ray: So it's a bit rigged. | {'express humor': 'Aniruddha Ray makes a humorous comment about being assigned the reporter role, implying the selection process was unfair because he is in breakout rooms four and seven.'}
[895.0s] Brad Smith: So um, | {'None': 'This utterance does not contain any content that can be mapped to the provided codes.'}

[898.0s] Brad Smith: Uh, can photoacoustic image save the day? I I don't know. maybe shouldn't use that phrase, but it's photoacoustic imaging has promise, I don't know, has has promise and challenges. I don't know um. | {'present new idea': {'Explanation': 'Brad Smith introduces the idea of photoacoustic imaging potentially solving the deep tissue imaging problem, which is a new direction in the conversation.'}, 'express enthusiasm': {'Explanation': 'Brad Smith expresses enthusiasm for photoacoustic imaging by asking if it can "save the day", but then immediately retracts the enthusiasm by saying "I don\'t know" and questioning the phrase.'}}
[900.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: Voltage sensor imaging is super important for neuroscience because despite the dominance of really heavily engineered GFP based calcium sensors, we know that calcium reporting of neural activity is really limited. Uh, it's got really slow temporal kinetics, which helped us at first because we didn't have a good imaging methods to go faster. | {'provide supporting evidence': 'Genia supports the importance of voltage sensor imaging by stating that calcium reporting of neural activity is limited due to its slow temporal kinetics, which was previously discussed in the context of genetic reporters.', 'explain or define term or concept': 'Genia explains why voltage sensor imaging is important for neuroscience, providing context for its use and limitations compared to calcium sensors.'}
[904.0s] Brad Smith: Yeah. | {'acknowledge contribution': 'Brad Smith says "Yeah" in response to Luke\'s suggestion of using photoacoustic imaging to identify a region of interest and then using a fluorescent tag associated with it, acknowledging Luke\'s contribution but not necessarily agreeing or expanding on it.'}
[905.0s] Brad Smith: I mean, I understand that problem in sort of in a clinical circumstance that you see a large piece of tissue and then you go in and then you try to do it almost cellular level microscopy. | {'explain or define term or concept': 'Brad is explaining the problem of needing to bridge the gap between large-scale tissue imaging and high-resolution cellular microscopy in a clinical setting, which is relevant to the discussion on deep tissue imaging modalities.', 'present new idea': 'Brad is presenting a new idea of bridging the gap between large-scale tissue imaging and high-resolution cellular microscopy in a clinical setting.'}
[911.0s] Brad Smith: What are the challenges, Carolyn? | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith is directly asking Carolyn for her input on the challenges of photoacoustic imaging, encouraging her to participate in the discussion.'}
[911.0s] Brad Smith: Adding then deep tissue on top of that seems a really difficult problem. Um. | {'express frustration': 'Brad expresses that adding deep tissue imaging to the problem of imaging a large piece of tissue and then doing cellular level microscopy seems like a difficult problem, indicating frustration.'}
[913.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Well, spatial resolution, right? So we're obviously not in the same domain as far as spatial resolution. So um, and then when you start thinking about how to improve spatial resolution, then sensitivity becomes a problem, you know, as you're imaging smaller and smaller objects. | [{'explain or define term or concept': 'Carolyn is explaining the limitations of photoacoustic imaging, specifically spatial resolution, which is relevant because Brad asked about the challenges of photoacoustic imaging.'}, {'provide supporting evidence': 'Carolyn provides supporting evidence by stating that improving spatial resolution leads to sensitivity problems, which is a challenge in photoacoustic imaging.'}]
[916.0s] Brad Smith: Uh see Shim. | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith is inviting Shim to speak next and share their modality, continuing the round of introductions.'}
[917.0s] Sixian You: Hi everyone. My name is Sishan Yo. Uh, I recently started in electric engineering department at MIT. My background is in optics and microscopy. Uh, so, uh, we are very much troubled by deep tissue imaging because uh, we're we're blessed with this submicro resolution but we can rarely go deeper than millimeter uh depth. So what my lab does, uh, we want to tackle this issue and also a lot of other like imaging speed or contrast issue from three aspects. The first aspect is uh, um multiphoton imaging. | {'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker is introducing themself and their background in optics and microscopy, providing context for their subsequent statements about deep tissue imaging.', 'present new idea': 'The speaker introduces the idea that their lab wants to tackle the deep tissue imaging issue, along with imaging speed and contrast issues, from three aspects, which is a new approach being presented.', 'expand on existing idea': 'The speaker mentions multiphoton imaging as the first aspect of their approach to tackle deep tissue imaging, building upon the previously mentioned problem of deep tissue imaging.'}
[919.0s] Brad Smith: Maybe we we'll we'll put a pin in that one as well. | {'propose decision': "Brad suggests to 'put a pin' in the current topic, which means to postpone the discussion, so the code applies."}
[926.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Just just to throw an idea out there not to talk about photoacoustics again, but people have tried to take temporal characteristics, right? | {'present new idea': "Carolyn is introducing a new idea related to temporal characteristics, which hasn't been discussed in the immediate context, to address the problem of deep tissue imaging."}
[926.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Yeah. | [{'express agreement': "Carolyn simply agrees with Brad's previous statement, indicating alignment in the conversation."}]
[927.0s] Brad Smith: I think a couple of you are experts at at like fibers or wave guides or things that actually send the light in. Do you want to? | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith is encouraging someone to contribute to the discussion by asking if they want to talk about fibers or waveguides for sending light in, following a discussion about imaging modalities and deep tissue imaging.'}
[929.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: Uh, but it's slow, you know, it misses neuronal action potentials. It doesn't report hyperpolarization very well unless on a really slow time scale. Uh, it doesn't tell you very much about, you know, not nothing about sub threshold events, which is | {'provide supporting evidence': 'Genia is providing evidence to support the point that current calcium reporters are limited by explaining that they have slow temporal kinetics and miss neuronal action potentials, building on the discussion about genetic reporters and their limitations for voltage sensing.', 'expand on existing idea': 'Genia expands on the limitations of calcium reporters, which was brought up by Brad and Sixian, by detailing specific issues like slow temporal kinetics and inability to report hyperpolarization well.'}
[932.0s] Carolyn Bayer: Where you have something that's blinking, um, and use that to improve resolution, right? So you can. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Carolyn is expanding on the idea of integrative techniques for wide field screening of tissue, by suggesting the use of temporal characteristics to improve resolution, building upon the previous discussion about identifying regions of interest for high magnification imaging.'}
[935.0s] Barbara Smith: So what do we do in my lab? We're using um we're using actually clinically and clinical and research tools um to translate light and sound. And so we use electrodes as our wave guides to um to send light down, uh target a molecule of interest in the in the deep tissue um that uh might have a some genetic marker. And then um we we can get both sound wave and light wave back up the electrode. | {'explain or define term or concept': "The speaker is explaining their lab's approach to translating light and sound using electrodes as waveguides, which clarifies their methodology for the group.", 'expand on existing idea': "The speaker is expanding on the discussion of deep tissue imaging modalities by describing their lab's specific techniques using electrodes to deliver light and sound, building upon the previous discussion of photoacoustics and other methods."}
[935.0s] Aniruddha Ray: Right and and depth is, sorry, go ahead. | [{'encourage particpatioin': 'Aniruddha Ray says "go ahead" to encourage the other speaker to continue their thought, after Carolyn Bayer started to speak about the challenges of photoacoustic imaging.'}]
[936.0s] Brad Smith: Yeah, no it's incredibly. The timer started going. Yes, it is very hard to talk with a clock in front of you, isn't it? It's a thing. It's a Well, thank you very much to everybody. It's uh these sessions are always a little draining when everyone's staring at each other and trying to overcome that flight or fight. | [{'express enthusiasm': 'Brad expresses enthusiasm by saying "Yeah, no it\'s incredibly" to the previous speaker\'s explanation.'}, {'express humor': 'Brad expresses humor by saying "Yes, it is very hard to talk with a clock in front of you, isn\'t it?".'}]
