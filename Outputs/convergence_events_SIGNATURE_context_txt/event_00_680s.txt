[659.0s] Brad Smith: If if I just go to the prompt that we had, um, maybe as a as to kick this out, um, maybe start out with optical ideas, which I think is the central to all of that and then let you guys take it, but the first one there is, | {'propose decision': 'Brad suggests to start with optical ideas as a central point for discussion, which is a concrete choice for the group to focus on.', 'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad invites the group to take over the discussion after he introduces the topic, encouraging them to contribute.'}
[660.0s] Brad Smith: to increase the number. If anybody has any comment of it increasing the quality of those statements, go ahead. Um otherwise we got a couple of minutes so Barbara if you want to I don't know if anybody had any more of those wave guide questions for you. | [{'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith is encouraging participation by inviting comments to improve the quality of the bullet points that were just created.'}]
[661.0s] Brad Smith: Maybe focus on your modality because I think when you get that's where we're going to be. Either your problem that you're trying to solve in deep tissue or the modality that you think you can bring to the problem. | {'assign task': 'Brad Smith is assigning Aniruddha Ray the task of focusing on their modality when speaking.', 'explain or define term or concept': 'Brad Smith is clarifying the focus of the discussion, which is either the problem being solved in deep tissue or the modality that can be brought to the problem.'}
[662.0s] Barbara Smith: Sounds sounds great. Yeah. Should we have should we talk now? We talk later. So maybe we'll keep on we'll keep on. | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Barbara Smith is encouraging further discussion by suggesting they can talk now or later, inviting Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy to engage further.', 'propose decision': 'Barbara Smith proposes a decision on whether to talk now or later, suggesting a course of action for the group.'}
[664.0s] Brad Smith: I presume that always has a huge sensitivity problem, yeah. | {'provide supporting evidence': 'Brad Smith is commenting on the technology of rejecting scattered light and collecting only ballistic photons, and he presumes that this approach would have a huge sensitivity problem, providing a logical reasoning to weaken the idea.', 'express agreement': 'Brad Smith ends his statement with "yeah", expressing agreement with the unstated but implied idea that rejecting scattered light has a sensitivity problem.'}
[667.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: So, I and I think there are some ways to think about light sheet applications as related to depth, but its primary power is in gentleness and speed and not necessarily in depth. | {'expand on existing idea': 'Genia expands on the discussion about light sheet microscopy, adding that its primary power lies in gentleness and speed, not necessarily depth, which builds upon the previous discussion about the capabilities of light sheet microscopy.', 'provide supporting evidence': 'Genia provides supporting evidence by stating that light sheet applications are related to depth, but its primary power is in gentleness and speed, not necessarily in depth, which supports her argument about the limitations of light sheet microscopy for deep tissue imaging.'}
[668.0s] Sixian You: Exactly because the ballistic photons decay exponentially with depth. | {'provide supporting evidence': "Sixian is providing a reason why collecting only ballistic photons has a sensitivity problem, building on Brad's question about the feasibility of the technology."}
[668.0s] Alexandra Dickinson: I have a question about it kind of ties into something we were talking about in our last breakout session, so not most of you weren't there, but um, we were talking about how fluorescence is very, very specific to certain molecules, a single molecule and how some of the other really cool imaging techniques that have are have a lot of use are not as specific. I'm wondering for photoacoustic imaging, you know, I hear a lot about detecting hemoglobin and I assume that's because it's very concentrated and has sort of spectral properties that are that are easy to detect using a photoacoustic imaging. What other kinds of molecules can you detect and um, yeah, what is the kind of specificity? | {'ask clarifying question': "Jazz is asking about the specificity of photoacoustic imaging and what other molecules besides hemoglobin can be detected, seeking clarification on the technique's capabilities, building on a discussion from a previous session about the specificity of fluorescence."}
[671.0s] Aniruddha Ray: Oh, there is Stephen Barbara. So Danny, can see you. Hey Danny. | [{'acknowledge contribution': 'Aniruddha acknowledges the presence of Stephen Barbara and Danny, recognizing their presence in the meeting.'}]
[671.0s] Brad Smith: Yeah, let's put a pin in that and if we find we have a bit of uh a bit of a lag, we'll come back to that. I I want to help Jazz out a little bit because she's the only one in the whole conference I think doing plants and it seemed to me that plants have got like something around the outside so sticking an electrode into a plant might be the way to go. Is has that ever been thought about or uh what what's the problem that we could help you with, Jazz? | [{'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith encourages Jazz to participate by asking about the problems she faces with plant imaging and how the group can help, after a discussion about fiber optic and wave guides.'}]
[673.0s] Brad Smith: Yeah. | [{'express agreement': 'Brad Smith is agreeing with a previous statement, but the specific statement is not clear from the immediate context.'}]
[675.0s] Brad Smith: Are there methods beyond confocal and light sheet to address 3D regions deep within a tissue sample. | {'ask clarifying question': 'Brad is initiating the discussion by posing a question about alternative methods for deep tissue imaging beyond confocal and light sheet microscopy, seeking to clarify the possibilities in this area.'}
[675.0s] Barbara Smith: Sorry, sorry. I have a little human that required me for a few minutes. | {'express humor': 'The speaker makes a lighthearted comment about being delayed by a child, which can be interpreted as an attempt to inject humor into the situation.'}
[677.0s] Brad Smith: Um, maybe we should um, either we can go to the Google document um, to start starting our bullet points since Andrew set out now the chopper. | [{'propose decision': 'Brad proposes the decision to move to the Google document to start outlining bullet points, suggesting a concrete action for the group.'}]
[680.0s] Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy: But if you think about, you know, broadly light shaping applications, I think would be would have been a better word to put there because light sheet to me it means that you rely somehow on camera based, um, sensor imaging, but light shaping applications are super broad and can rely on point detectors as well as camera based imaging and any kind of sensor that you want. And that's where I think there's a lot of | {'explain or define term or concept': "Genia explains that 'light sheet' implies camera-based sensor imaging, while 'light shaping applications' is broader and includes point detectors, clarifying the distinction between the two terms in the context of deep tissue imaging."}
[680.0s] Barbara Smith: Yeah, I'd be glad I'd be glad to navigate. | [{'express agreement': "Barbara Smith expresses agreement to navigate the discussion, indicating she is willing to help guide the conversation based on Brad's request."}]
[682.0s] Aniruddha Ray: Um, so, uh, my name is Anirud. I'm from University of Toledo. I work on two different things. So I work on nanotechnology aided optical imaging, which involves fluorescence as well as photoacoustics. And that's what is my interest in deep tissue imaging. I also work on lensless holographic microscopy, um, but that is more for Xvivo samples or in vitro samples. So we basically develop different types of nanoparticles, um, metallic quantum dots, um, um, polymeric nanoparticles for biomedical imaging, sensing, as well as for therapy, uh, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy. And we monitor them using fluorescence and photoacoustics, as well as some scattering and other things. | [{'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker explains their research focus, including nanotechnology-aided optical imaging, fluorescence, photoacoustics, lensless holographic microscopy, and the types of nanoparticles they develop, providing context for their interest in deep tissue imaging as requested by Brad.'}]
[682.0s] Brad Smith: That seems to me rather and some of you people are really focused on that. So where do you see in the next five years, let's say beyond light sheet, uh, how to how do people view that? | {'ask clarifying question': 'Brad is asking the group about their perspectives on methods beyond light sheet for deep tissue imaging in the next five years, seeking their expert opinions on the future of the field.'}
[685.0s] Brad Smith: You call it an electrode. I'm a little confused as an outsider. Why do you use the word electrode? That implies to me electrochemistry. | [{'ask clarifying question': "Brad is asking Barbara to clarify why she uses the term 'electrode' in the context of her waveguide technology, as it implies electrochemistry to him."}]
[690.0s] Aniruddha Ray: Sure, I can start to summarize and we can conclude this discussion. | [{'assign task': 'Aniruddha Ray volunteers to summarize the discussion and conclude the session, thus taking on the task of summarizing and concluding.'}, {'propose decision': 'Aniruddha Ray suggests to summarize and conclude the discussion, which is a decision to end the discussion.'}]
[692.0s] Barbara Smith: Yeah, so we do it's electrophysiology. So um the micropipette electrode um was developed I think it's around the 1960s and um they record neuronal activity. It's a high resolution recording of typically single neurons um and their activity level um with the with the um basically I won't go into detail. Um so the electrode is placed into the brain and um it's typically done either um blind or um using optical microscopy approaches from from external sources. So uh a microscope on the outside. And and so what ends up happening is if you have um if you work with this blind, you would use like probably a DIC microscope and um you can do this in vivo and the electrode is placed in and uh positive pressure is is pushed into the electrode as it's moved through the brain tissue so that that electrode doesn't get clogged. The tip of the electrode is about um one to three microns in diameter and that electrode is is moved little very very very slowly into the brain um and there's no way to target selective cells of interest using the blind approach, but you can get deeper, right? So um the only way the most basic way that they know that they've hit a cell of interest is by creating a connection between that electrode and that cell. So they place it from a positive pressure and then we make a negative pressure from that. We create a bleb, so it sucks up part of that membrane of the cell. Um we um increase the pressure and it opens up the cell membrane so that there's a direct connection between that electrode and the fluids within the electrode and the cell um solution. And and what ends up happening is the um it ends up being able to record that cell, but you don't know what cell you're hitting until you start recording it. And if you've started recording the wrong cell, you have to remove that micropipette electrode um throw it out, place a new one in and then enter into the brain one more time. And so uh it's kind of a hunt and peck process. You can get deeper and people can record very well uh neuroscientists have been recording like that for for decades. Um but lately with two photon microscopy, you can get down to about a millimeter and you can genetically alter or place in different kinds of dyes and and selectively target neurons up to a millimeter. But past the millimeter from the cortical surface, um there are minimal ways to do it. So you can suction out a portion of the brain. Um that's one way to do it and then the animal is still alive and you can move down um and you can do within a millimeter of whatever area you've sectioned. Um or if you're coming from the top, you can see cells about within a millimeter of of where that surface is. If you're exceptional if you're doing three photon or multi photon, you can get maybe two millimeters. Um it's a little bit rough. Um but the way that we're doing this is oh oh is we're integrating light and sound into that micropipette electrode so you don't need a microscope on the outside to guide that cell. And so um we can get uh stains and genetic um uh genetic contrast throughout the brain and now we can we can tap into cells um of interest at at depths beyond one millimeter as deep as that. So we're combining um blind and an imaging guided approach by doing this, but without the microscope on the outside. Hope that made sense. | [{'explain or define term or concept': 'The speaker explains electrophysiology and the use of micropipette electrodes for recording neuronal activity, providing background information on the technique and its limitations.'}, {'expand on existing idea': 'The speaker expands on the concept of using electrodes as waveguides, detailing the traditional methods of electrode placement and the improvements her lab is making by integrating light and sound.'}]
[695.0s] Brad Smith: Let's uh, let's. | [{'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad is encouraging participation by pausing and allowing others to speak, as he is looking for input from the group.'}]
[696.0s] Aniruddha Ray: One point, are we, are we on slide 55 or should we be on 54? | {'ask clarifying question': 'Aniruddha is asking a clarifying question about which slide to focus on, seeking to understand the correct reference point for the discussion.'}
[699.0s] Alexandra Dickinson: I mean, I was thinking that would be really cool and I don't think it's been done to my knowledge. Um, so I think that would be something pretty exciting to try. I mean, I was just thinking, you know, as everybody was talking, um, something like you can think of plants are as super regenerators, right? Like a a bamboo plant for instance, if you ever have bamboo in your yard and you're trying to get rid of it, it's not going to happen. Like that plan is going to grow back. You can chop it down, you can cut off the roots, it will grow back. So it would be really cool to to look at a tissue like that that's really thick. Um, if you could get, you know, a centimeter or two into that tissue and and look at the, you know, the regeneration processes. I think that would be really cool application of of this kind of technology that uh has not been to my knowledge done at all before. | [{'present new idea': "Jazz suggests using the electrode technology to image thick, regenerating plant tissues, which she believes hasn't been done before, presenting a novel application of the technology."}, {'express enthusiasm': 'Jazz expresses excitement about the potential of using the electrode technology to image thick, regenerating plant tissues, indicating her enthusiasm for this new application.'}]
[701.0s] Brad Smith: Yeah, we're 54, 3.4, deep tissue imaging. | [{'explain or define term or concept': 'Brad is clarifying the slide number and topic being discussed, which is deep tissue imaging, to ensure everyone is on the same page.'}]
[704.0s] Brad Smith: And some of you are working exactly on this problem. So, you know, you can pump up why you're going to solve it, uh, | {'encourage particpatioin': 'Brad Smith is encouraging those who are working on the problem of imaging deep within a tissue sample to share their ideas and explain how they plan to solve it, building on the previous question about methods beyond confocal and light sheet.'}
