Um so just two things. I during uh Zoom meetings, I I often use the chat quite a bit because I don't like to interrupt and I think it's actually a good way for other people to be able to have a little bit of a sidebar but there's also a record of of the chat. So, um if I do put things in there, I am listening. I I just uh find that's also a useful uh notepad. Um in terms of so so the earlier discussion is is great. I I think that's really helpful. Um I just maybe take a a step back to to look at the framing of the the question. So so the idea was that uh what are the commonalities um of worlds that um are basically alive or have a ecosystems. And um I guess the two uh key things that come to mind uh would be uh when and where uh because those commonalities are going to be radically different depending on when in the history you're you're you're considering on that body. And the the other key issue is where by which I mean um that the planetary system itself. So, um this sort of if we take a step back and think about would we expect commonalities between living worlds? And the answer may be yes, but I I think that it's quite likely that you would have classes of living world. And so the commonalities aren't going to be the same over all worlds. If you have a world that is uh drowned in deeper oceans, so a super Earth that ends up putting more water onto the surface and you simply don't have continents, then um it doesn't mean that that it will undergo the same types of uh development and share commonality with a world that does have continents. And so um on some basic level we could think about um initial conditions plus life leading to either states of divergence or convergence and are there particular classes that might exist at a particular time that would be indicative of of life. But I wouldn't expect a super Earth uh especially one which was an ocean world to have the same types of bio signatures, the same commonalities uh that that that we see on on worlds with continents or other radically different living worlds. So, um just to think about the question, would we actually expect there to be commonality uh between living worlds or are there classes of living world that um through the biological calculation process where life is trying to create a stable environment that you lock into one of these classes um and we should be comparing between those classes rather than across all worlds.",True,False,False,2021SLU_2021_06_10_SLU,6.0,37.0,196.0,600.0,2975.0,3012.0,3171.0,50.2

And you also don't want to have a attenuated virus that is not too attenuated that it will revert to wild type.

So what they have been doing is produce this multi uh like sort of like it's not a multivalent vaccine because it's a single protein but having epitopes uh from the different strains. Uh and take that and also couple it with something that could be targeted. So in cancer uh vaccine development they are trying to do target immunity. So they put receptors in whatever protein or molecule uh you are vaccinated uh your subjects with uh so that it uh increases the interaction with a specific innate immune cell because now we know how to trigger specific immune responses like if we target dendritic cells, we're going to have interferon gamma and that is going to lead to IGG antibodies of this class. So if we take all the information together and start that we have been seeing in vaccine development for cancer and we put it in infection disease development and we do something like that like right now if you think about the COVID vaccine, that is a liposome.

So I'm trying to figure out how this relates to what's been being discussed with reservoirs because I mean, I know a lot of the stuff hasn't been tested, but, you know, take Japanese encephalitis virus or something like that where it's mainly considered, you know, in Japan a little bit in Australia, but, you know, it's spreading a little bit. So when you talk about maybe testing some of the reservoirs, are you would you for to see if it's emerging into like nearby areas, would you start testing those areas for JB although it had it hasn't been ever isolated there to see if there's any reservoir populations or something like that. And then if you are doing it, is it going to expand to other areas just to try to eventually see if it's possible for some of these pathogens to be going into new areas and having reservoirs in new areas just because we don't know, especially with some of the vector born, you know, with um with wildlife and or not wildlife, with livestock, agricultural animals being shipped and stuff like that. I I guess my question is is how do you control for some of the emerging viruses and trying to detect the emerging viruses and stuff like that.

Um and we identified several gaps, ideas and challenges uh to report out about. So, um from a gaps perspective, um infrastructure gaps are huge. So technologically speaking, you know, having sensors and tools to do monitoring and precision surveillance, you know, there are some tools out there already, there are some sensors coming online, but really we need to be, you know, filling some of these infrastructure gaps to develop these these necessary tools. Having the people with the necessary expertise to do the surveillance can be a challenge, especially on the scale that we realistically need to do, you know, so much surveillance for so many diverse uh pathogen systems out there. Um and then, you know, a similar concept that was discussed yesterday after the vector born disease is surveillance follows the money. Um and, you know, there's not always a lot of money in in the prevention, there's the money in the cleanup after something happens. Um and so realistically finding ways to fund um the surveillance aspects so we can prevent a problem before it even becomes an issue, um is going to be key. Um, we need to be developing novel and and newer technologies and deploying those in the field. I know there are several new technologies that are being tested right now all all around the world. Um, but really getting those up and online um sooner rather than later is is key to preventing the next, you know, big outbreak. Um, we need to be optimizing where surveillance is being conductive. Um, and and this is kind of in reference to, you know, in areas where you've got a university or you've got a big city, you tend to have a whole lot of surveillance going around in a very limited scope around those locations. But then you've got the rest of the world that maybe isn't getting nearly enough surveillance, you know, effort going into them. So are there ways we can model the best optimized surveillance networks to get the best bang for our buck. Um, we we talked about the possibility of having universal assays of pathogens that we can use in many, many different systems. So you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you can use the same assays across diverse systems, um using variable tech. Um and we also talked about the possibility of using environmental DNA techniques for the surveillance of of smaller animals and vectors, um where you maybe can't put wearable tech on a mouse or a mosquito, um but you can use DNA that's present in the environment to kind of monitor and surveil those populations. Um and and really we just talked about the gap of that communication barrier between the engineers and the biologist. So you've got a biologist who knows exactly what they want to measure, but they don't really know the engineering challenges behind how they get there. And then you have the engineers who know how to get there, but they're not entirely clear on on what the biologists are looking for. So finding a way to bridge that gap so we can make sure there's clear communication in the precision surveillance tools that we're looking for. So we had a couple of interesting ideas. Um, and one of the big ones that we talked about kind of at length was um using chemical signals to sense pathogens in the environment passively. Um, so you know, possibly using color sensor technology, um, you know, for like a vector born disease, if a mosquito deposited deposits virus on this color changing card and the card changes color, then we know that there was virus deposited there, we know there's virus in the environment. So talking about using um color changing technology to to possibly monitor uh pathogens in in the wild. Um, and and it also came up talking about nanoparticle sensors, um where we've got antibodies on these nanoparticle sensors that will change color upon detection of antigens and and you can use that in diverse systems, it's not just vector born diseases, but also in situations where you've got um more directly transmitted pathogens as well in an animal, um animal to animal contact environment. Um, and then challenges and opportunities. This left us with a lot of questions and not always a lot of answers. Um and that's because surveillance has to kind of assume a lot of different forms based on what you're looking at. So surveiling for mosquito board diseases is going to be very different from surveiling for brucelosis. And so we kind of talked about some of those differences and challenges moving forward. Um, and ultimately how does precision testing translate into action? So we can test for everything in the world, we can do all the surveillance in the world, but how do we take those data and actually put them into action and and act on them. Um, how what do you do and when do you enact some type of action after after making that surveillance. Um, realistically a big challenge is coming out with simple tools that minimize personnel requirements. Not everybody has, you know, a huge group of people who can go in and do a million PCRs and do a million identifications of mosquitoes and do a whole lot of this work. We need simple tools that can be used by anybody, possibly even a citizen science approach, um that will improve surveillance on a large scale. And then we talked about a very serious uh surveillance challenge on kind of smaller family farms that can be the source of disease because there can be barriers there where, you know, people don't want you to make that detection on their farm. It can mean something bad for their farm if you detect something in their animals. So so there's a very real challenge in uh kind of bridging those cultural barriers and even legal barriers with our our farm so we can do surveillance, but not in a way that harms anybody's livelihood. Um, so like I said, very good conversation in our group. We talked about a lot of things. I tend to think we're the best group.",True,True,True,2021MZT_2021_10_01_MZT,4.0,60.0,407.0,599.0,1803.0,1863.0,2210.0,31.05

How this movement how we can surve make a surveillance trying to detect what those animals are coming or um bringing sorry, I don't know uh to an area that we we we haven't that before.

Okay, we have this new, we have this parasite that we we haven't seen this before, this this genome or this strain here. How is this going to to be a risk for the other animals in the area and human. Or the bacteria or and what will be in these animals or the um as as uh mentioned or no Jenny where exactly we are going to detect. I think you you you ask about the different materials, no? Is is not the same when we are doing uh diagnostic in blood that we are doing diagnostic in in feces or you know? So what is is the also for us or in terms of surveillance to collect from animals. So so these these are things that we need to think to to to put this this this area, this area and this area, the question that we have for this specific uh animals in this area regarding the environmental changes that they are suffering what this is different south southern US uh US from northern US.

Naturally, the host has its own innate molecules that it activates uh right upon being infected by a parasite. That's before the actual adaptive immunity kicks in. So that innate immune responses are the ones that are responsible for stopping parasites from affecting certain hosts and then parasites will be able to infect other hosts based on how they interact with the host at that level. So perhaps this is a classical example of looking at how parasite molecules interact with the host and how the host molecules try to stop the parasite and vice versa.",False,True,False,2021MZT_2021_10_01_MZT,1.0,81.0,187.0,601.0,3514.0,3595.0,3701.0,59.916666666666664
